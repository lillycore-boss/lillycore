PLAN

Phase / scope

Parent card: P0.3 – Establish Documentation Structure & Update Rules (Phase 0, documentation governance).

Subsystems touched:

Docs layer + build docs (PROJECT_CANON, LILLYCORE_ROADMAP, FEATURES, TECH_SPEC, MODULES, GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX).

Repository layout (TECH_SPEC Section 3) for where docs live.

Key decisions already fixed by you

Use two separate files:

docs/documentation_governance.md – system-level doc types & hierarchy.

docs/build/documentation_protocol.md – build-only update protocol & GPT behaviour.

P0.3 should define a phase-agnostic, long-term framework (not just Phase 0).

Architects may propose new docs only when they truly SHOULD exist, and must push you for approval; runtime-generated artefacts (logs, etc.) are out of scope for P0.3 and can be defined later.

Build protocol must not duplicate rules already in Canon/Tech Spec/etc.; if it centralizes rules, the old copies should be removed and replaced with references, and the protocol doc must be added to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX and the “always-load” set.

Decomposition choice (per Canon §8)

P0.3 is small enough to express as ≤10 leaf-level tasks, so this invocation will produce only leaf-level Implementer cards (plus a QA end-cap), no extra Architect layer.

I’ll output:

P0.3.1–P0.3.7 → Implementer cards (leaf tasks).

P0.3.8 → QA card for the whole P0.3 bundle (required by Canon).

DOC — P0.3 CARD SET (LEAF-LEVEL)

Each card follows the Architect card structure from Canon §8.

Card P0.3.1

ID: P0.3.1
Title: Define Documentation Layers & Categories (System-Level Governance)
Type: Implementer

Description (1–3 sentences):
Define the core documentation layers and categories for LillyCORE at the system level, independent of specific files. Clarify what kinds of docs the project should and should not have (conceptually), including build docs, system docs, user docs, plugin docs, and runtime artefacts, without yet specifying file paths. This becomes the foundation of docs/documentation_governance.md.

Steps (3–10):

Review PROJECT_CANON §3–§6 and TECH_SPEC §3 to extract all existing hints about doc layers, naming, and layout (including docs/build vs docs/user/api).

Define a concise list of doc layer types, e.g.:

Build/System docs (e.g., Canon, Roadmap, Tech Spec, Modules, GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX).

System-level conceptual docs (e.g., high-level architecture explanations).

Plugin-specific docs (per plugin).

User-facing docs (future docs/user, docs/api).

Runtime-generated artefacts (logs, snapshots, transcripts) – described as a category only.

For each layer type, define:

Purpose (why it exists),

Who reads it (Andrew, GPTs, end users, etc.),

Who owns/maintains it (Architect, Implementer, engine/plugin owners, etc.),

Whether it is build-only (OK to throw away with the repo) or system-level.

Explicitly define the “should have” doc categories (strongly encouraged/required) vs “may have” vs “must not have” (e.g., ban random ad-hoc spec files that bypass GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX).

Write the initial docs/documentation_governance.md with:

Title/header block,

“Purpose” section,

“Doc Layers & Categories” section containing the above definitions.

Ensure no contradictions with existing PROJECT_CANON §4 (Documentation Standards); if overlap exists, leave Canon alone for now and mark the potential duplication for P0.3.6 to resolve.

Present the draft to Andrew for confirmation that the category set matches his intent before any refactors in other docs are performed.

Done When:

docs/documentation_governance.md exists and clearly defines the doc layer categories and ownership at a system level.

Andrew confirms the categories and “should/may/must-not-have” rules are aligned with his expectations.

Any potential overlap with Canon §4 is noted (not yet changed) as input for P0.3.6.

Deliverable:

New file: docs/documentation_governance.md (initial version with Purpose + Doc Layers & Categories).

Short note listing any overlaps with PROJECT_CANON §4 to be handled in P0.3.6.

Card P0.3.2

ID: P0.3.2
Title: Define Documentation Hierarchy & Canonical File Roles
Type: Implementer

Description:
Map the conceptual layers from P0.3.1 onto concrete files and locations (existing and future), defining where each type of doc lives and how they relate. This extends docs/documentation_governance.md with a clear hierarchy diagram and roles for the major named docs.

Steps:

Using GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX and TECH_SPEC §3, list all existing named build docs (PROJECT_CANON, LILLYCORE_ROADMAP, FEATURES, TECH_SPEC, MODULES, GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX) and their current paths under docs/build/.

For each existing build doc, define in documentation_governance.md:

Its layer (build doc vs system doc vs something else),

Its role (e.g., global rules vs technical standards vs roadmap vs module map vs feature template),

Who owns it (Architect/Implementer/Andrew) at a high level.

Define a small, explicit list of future doc types that are allowed to appear later (e.g., *_ENGINE_SPEC, per-plugin specs, UX spec), connecting each to a doc layer/category from P0.3.1 without naming specific filenames.

Add a section “Documentation Hierarchy & Relationships” to documentation_governance.md that:

Describes parent/child relationships (e.g., Canon > Roadmap > Modules/Tech Spec > Features),

Clarifies that GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX is the directory of build/system docs and must be updated whenever docs are added or change meaning.

Include a simple text hierarchy or ASCII tree (not repo layout, but conceptual hierarchy), e.g., Canon at the top, then Roadmap, then spec docs, then plugin docs, then features.

Ensure these definitions do not duplicate detailed path rules already in TECH_SPEC §3; instead, reference TECH_SPEC for physical layout when needed (e.g. “See TECH_SPEC Section 3 for exact folder structure”).

Review with Andrew to confirm that the hierarchy matches how he mentally thinks about the docs and their authority order.

Done When:

documentation_governance.md has a clear “Documentation Hierarchy & Relationships” section that maps conceptual layers to existing and allowed future doc types.

The roles of PROJECT_CANON, LILLYCORE_ROADMAP, FEATURES, TECH_SPEC, MODULES, and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX are clearly described without duplicating their internal content.

Andrew confirms that the authority ordering between docs is correct.

Deliverable:

Updated docs/documentation_governance.md with the hierarchy and file role descriptions.

Card P0.3.3

ID: P0.3.3
Title: Draft Build-Level Documentation Protocol (Roles & Triggers)
Type: Implementer

Description:
Create docs/build/documentation_protocol.md to centralize who updates what, when, and under what triggers, drawing from existing rules scattered across PROJECT_CANON, TECH_SPEC, FEATURES, and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX, but without duplicating full texts.

Steps:

Collect all existing rules about documentation updates and responsibilities from:

PROJECT_CANON §4, §8–§10 (documentation standards, Architect/Implementer/QA roles),

TECH_SPEC repo layout/docs rules,

FEATURES overview & template usage rules,

GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX overview & update rules.

Identify the behavioural rules that belong in a centralized “protocol” (e.g., “every change MUST update documentation”; “Implementer is always responsible for doc updates when executing a card”; “Canon changes require explicit Andrew approval”).

Create docs/build/documentation_protocol.md with sections such as:

Purpose & Scope (build-level protocol, not user docs),

Roles (Andrew, Architect, Implementer, QA) w.r.t. documentation,

Update Triggers (code change, architecture change, new module, new doc type, etc.),

“Stop and Ask Andrew” rules (explicitly referencing Canon’s Prime Directive).

Phrase this doc largely as a summary + pointer to detailed definitions in Canon/Tech Spec/Features, rather than copying text; where necessary, reference those docs by name instead of restating rules.

Ensure the protocol differentiates:

When Canon vs Roadmap vs TECH_SPEC vs MODULES vs FEATURES vs GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX must be changed,

Which role is allowed to propose vs actually edit each (with Andrew’s approval for Canon changes).

Include an explicit statement that documentation version numbers are symbolic and must not be used as logic, deferring to Git as source of truth, consistent with Canon §3–§4.

Share the draft with Andrew for feedback, especially on when GPTs must STOP and ask vs when they can autonomously apply the protocol.

Done When:

docs/build/documentation_protocol.md exists with clear sections on roles, triggers, and high-level behaviours.

The doc references, but does not duplicate, core rules from Canon/Tech Spec/Features/GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.

Andrew confirms that the behavioural rules match his expectations.

Deliverable:

New file: docs/build/documentation_protocol.md (first-pass protocol).

Card P0.3.4

ID: P0.3.4
Title: Define Formatting & Replacement Standards in Documentation Protocol
Type: Implementer

Description:
Extend documentation_protocol.md with explicit formatting and replacement rules (block headers, full-block replacement preference, ready-to-paste updates), centralizing what is currently scattered mainly in PROJECT_CANON §3–§4 and TECH_SPEC.

Steps:

Extract all formatting and update-style rules from PROJECT_CANON (block comments, “atomic file updates”, “ready-to-paste sections”) and TECH_SPEC’s expectations around docs layout.

In documentation_protocol.md, add a section “Formatting & Replacement Standards” that defines:

Required section header style (the # ======================================== pattern, etc.),

Preference for full-block replacements vs inline edits,

Requirement that GPTs present updates as ready-to-paste blocks.

Clarify that build/system docs must be durable and easy to redraw (no fragile indentation-based structures), and that any exceptions must be explicitly approved by Andrew.

Explicitly state how GPTs should handle partial refactors:

Replace whole sections;

Do not interleave patch instructions;

Always clearly label sections to be replaced.

Add a small subsection clarifying that user-facing docs (future docs/user/, docs/api/) may follow different stylistic conventions, but must not house build/system docs or override their meanings.

Ensure this section does not contradict Canon §4; if small overlaps exist, treat them as authoritative in Canon but note in P0.3.6 that they should be trimmed to avoid duplication once the protocol is fully accepted.

Present the updated protocol section to Andrew for confirmation that it captures his expectations for how GPTs present changes.

Done When:

documentation_protocol.md explicitly defines formatting and replacement behaviour for build docs.

All relevant formatting rules are present here and consistent with Canon/Tech Spec.

Andrew agrees that this protocol section can become the primary reference for formatting behaviour.

Deliverable:

Updated docs/build/documentation_protocol.md with “Formatting & Replacement Standards” and related guidance.

Card P0.3.5

ID: P0.3.5
Title: Define Rules for Adding New Documents & Linking to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX
Type: Implementer

Description:
Codify when and how new docs may be added, reflecting your guidance that Architect should push for docs that truly SHOULD exist, never inventing unnecessary paperwork, and that all build/system docs must be listed in GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.

Steps:

In documentation_governance.md, add a section “New Document Types & Approval Rules” that describes:

Criteria for when a new conceptual doc type SHOULD be created,

That Architect proposes, Andrew explicitly approves, and then the doc is added.

In documentation_protocol.md, add a corresponding procedural section:

Steps for: propose → review with Andrew → create doc → add to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX,

Emphasize that GPTs must not create new docs purely to have work; they must justify the need.

Clarify that runtime-generated artefacts (logs, transcripts, snapshots, etc.) are not governed by GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX; they are defined by engines/plugins as they come online and only need governance if promoted to official spec docs.

Update both governance and protocol docs to state that no doc is considered “real” until it is added to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX with its name, type, status, path, description, usage, and access rules.

Add explicit language requiring Architect/Implementer GPTs to push Andrew when a doc seems necessary for system integrity, but to also explicitly label “optional” docs and not auto-create them.

Include guidance that user-facing docs (under docs/user/, docs/api/) are managed separately and may or may not be indexed in GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX, as Andrew decides in a future phase.

Present the updated text to Andrew to confirm that the “push me if it really should exist” behavior matches his intent.

Done When:

Governance + protocol docs clearly define when and how new docs are added.

The relationship with GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX is explicit and non-ambiguous.

The line between build/system docs vs runtime artefacts is spelled out.

Deliverable:

Updated sections in docs/documentation_governance.md and docs/build/documentation_protocol.md that define new-doc rules and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX linkage.

Card P0.3.6

ID: P0.3.6
Title: Refactor Existing Docs to De-Duplicate into Governance & Protocol**
Type: Implementer

Description:
Remove duplicated documentation-governance and protocol logic from PROJECT_CANON, TECH_SPEC, FEATURES, and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX where it is now centralized in the new docs, replacing them with short references. This satisfies your requirement that the build protocol not duplicate existing files.

Steps:

Identify all passages in PROJECT_CANON, TECH_SPEC, FEATURES, and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX that are now clearly centralized in:

documentation_governance.md,

documentation_protocol.md.

For each such passage, propose a minimal replacement pattern:

Keep any ontological or high-level planning statements in Canon (e.g., ontology of components, Prime Directive);

Move purely procedural/update behaviour into the protocol doc;

Keep TECH_SPEC focused on technical/structural constraints, not GPT behavioural policy.

For PROJECT_CANON, strictly obey Canon’s own rule: only change Canon where the underlying ontology or planning discipline is being clarified, and only with Andrew’s explicit approval; otherwise, replace duplicated procedural text with a short pointer, e.g., “Operational details of documentation updates are defined in DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.”

For TECH_SPEC, trim any now-duplicated behavioural rules about doc updates that are better expressed in documentation_protocol.md, replacing them with references and leaving layout/naming rules intact.

For FEATURES, ensure it continues to define feature card structure and optional mirrored cards, but references documentation_protocol for how/when FEATURE cards must be updated.

For GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX, keep its role as the directory but avoid re-stating general doc behaviour now covered in governance/protocol; instead, add brief references, e.g., “See DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE for doc categories and DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL for update behaviour.”

Present a diff-style summary (per file) to Andrew for sign-off before finalizing any Canon changes.

Done When:

Canon, Tech Spec, Features, and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX no longer contain redundant procedural doc-update rules that are now centralized.

References to the new governance/protocol docs are in place where appropriate.

Andrew confirms especially that Canon changes are acceptable.

Deliverable:

Ready-to-paste replacement blocks for affected sections in:

docs/build/project_canon.md,

docs/build/tech_spec.md,

docs/build/features.md,

docs/build/gpt_resource_index.md.

Card P0.3.7

ID: P0.3.7
Title: Update GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX to Register Governance & Protocol Docs and “Always-Load” Rules
Type: Implementer

Description:
Modify GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX so that the new documentation files (documentation_governance.md, documentation_protocol.md) are formally registered and the ingestion rules explicitly mention the protocol as part of the set GPTs must load before doing work.

Steps:

Add entries under GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX for:

DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE (or equivalent conceptual name) with type, status, path docs/documentation_governance.md, description, usage, and access instructions.

DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL (or similar) with type, status, path docs/build/documentation_protocol.md, description, usage, and access instructions.

In the OVERVIEW section, extend the description of how GPTs should think about docs to mention these two new docs as central to documentation behaviour and governance.

Add or update a short “Prompt usage / ingestion” subsection that states:

Architect and Implementer GPTs MUST load (at minimum) PROJECT_CANON, GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX, and DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL (and any others Andrew specifies) before performing reasoning or planning.

Ensure the new entries clearly mark whether each doc is build/system vs system-level per P0.3.1–P0.3.2 definitions.

Confirm that the physical paths match TECH_SPEC’s docs layout expectations (docs/build/ for build docs, docs/ for the top-level governance doc).

Present the GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX changes to Andrew to make sure the “always-load” rule matches his desired mental model.

Done When:

GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX includes well-formed entries for DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE and DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.

The ingestion rules explicitly mention DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL as part of the mandatory-load set.

The paths and descriptions are consistent with TECH_SPEC and documentation_governance.

Deliverable:

Ready-to-paste modifications to docs/build/gpt_resource_index.md.

Card P0.3.8

ID: P0.3.8
Title: QA for P0.3 Documentation Governance & Protocol Bundle
Type: QA

Description:
QA GPT validates that P0.3.1–P0.3.7 have fully established the documentation structure and update rules, without duplication, and that all required docs and cross-references are correct and approved by Andrew.

Steps (3–10):

Load the final versions of:

docs/documentation_governance.md,

docs/build/documentation_protocol.md,

Updated PROJECT_CANON, TECH_SPEC, FEATURES, GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.

For each card P0.3.1–P0.3.7, compare the implemented work to the card’s Steps, Done When, and Deliverables, ensuring there are no missing outputs.

Verify that:

No essential rule about documentation behaviour was lost during de-duplication,

Canon still contains ontological and planning-discipline rules, not low-level protocol details,

TECH_SPEC still owns repo layout and technical constraints.

Check that governance vs protocol docs are clearly separated:

Governance: conceptual doc types, hierarchy, allowed vs disallowed doc categories.

Protocol: behavioural/update rules for GPTs and humans.

Confirm GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX correctly lists all docs and that the ingestion rules now mention DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL as part of the mandatory-load set.

Ensure that all references between docs are consistent (no circular contradictions, no stale names/paths).

Confirm that the whole structure is phase-agnostic and will remain valid as new engines/plugins/docs are introduced in later phases.

Produce a PASS/FAIL decision with a short summary; on FAIL, generate corrective cards under P0.3.8.x following Canon’s QA rules.

Done When:

QA GPT returns PASS on P0.3.8, confirming that cards P0.3.1–P0.3.7 are fully satisfied and the doc ecosystem is coherent, non-duplicative, and approved by Andrew.

Deliverable:

QA report for P0.3 (PASS or FAIL with reasons).

If FAIL: corrective cards P0.3.8.x as required by Canon.
