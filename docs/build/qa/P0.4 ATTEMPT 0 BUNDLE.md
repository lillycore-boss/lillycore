# ========================================
# PHASE 0 — QA BUNDLE
# TARGET CARD: P0.4 — Finalize GPT Behaviour Standards & Ingestion Rules
# ========================================

This QA Bundle defines **all verification criteria** used by QA GPT to determine
whether Phase 0.4 is fully complete and ready to close.

The bundle contains **one unified QA checklist**, not multiple cards.  
QA GPT MUST evaluate each requirement strictly and mark PASS only if ALL criteria
are met.

If any requirement fails, QA GPT MUST:
- Output FAIL,
- List all deficiencies,
- Generate corrective cards under the P0.x branch.


# ========================================
# SECTION 1 — DOCUMENT CREATION REQUIREMENTS
# ========================================

### 1.1 GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC must exist
QA MUST verify:
- File exists at: `docs/build/gpt_behaviour_spec.md`
- File is complete and matches the expected structure:
    - Purpose & Scope
    - Build vs Runtime Separation
    - Global Behaviour Rules
    - Document Ingestion Rule
    - Feature Card Lifecycle
    - Role Profiles (Architect / Implementer / QA)
    - Templates & Prompt Relationships
    - Update Policy

### 1.2 GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC must fully replace scattered rules
QA MUST verify:
- No other canonical doc continues to define GPT behaviour outside:
    - GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC
    - DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL (procedures only)
    - DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE (doc layers only)
    - PROJECT_CANON (philosophical anchors only)

GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC must be the **authoritative behavioural doc**.


# ========================================
# SECTION 2 — DOCUMENT UPDATE REQUIREMENTS
# ========================================

### 2.1 GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX updated
QA MUST verify:
- A DOCUMENT entry named `GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC` exists.
- Path is correct.
- Type: `process_rules`.
- Description accurately states purpose.
- Usage and access rules are present.

### 2.2 DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE updated
QA MUST verify:
- Build-process docs are explicitly distinguished from runtime system docs.
- GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC is referenced correctly.

### 2.3 DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL updated
QA MUST verify:
- References to GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC appear under “relationship to other docs”.
- Behaviour rules are NOT duplicated there.

### 2.4 PROJECT_CANON (optional but allowed)
If you added the note:
- QA MUST check it is accurate.
If you did **not**, QA MUST accept that the optional requirement was intentionally omitted.

(Your message indicates you omitted the Canon update, which is allowed.)


# ========================================
# SECTION 3 — GPT ROLE PROFILE ALIGNMENT
# ========================================

QA MUST verify:
- Architect GPT prompt references GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC as behavioural authority.
- Implementer GPT prompt references GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC as behavioural authority.
- QA GPT prompt references GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC as behavioural authority.
- Prompts DO NOT duplicate obsolete rules replaced by GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC.
- Prompts maintain role boundaries (Architect ≠ Implementer ≠ QA).


# ========================================
# SECTION 4 — ISSUE TEMPLATE ALIGNMENT
# ========================================

QA MUST verify:
- “LillyCORE Card Alpha” template references GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC.
- The ingestion rule inside the template matches the canonical form in
  GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC.
- Template does NOT redefine role rules that are now centralized.


# ========================================
# SECTION 5 — DONE-WHEN CRITERIA FOR P0.4
# ========================================

QA MUST confirm ALL of the following:

1. `GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC` exists, is complete, and adheres to spec structure.
2. GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX references the new file correctly.
3. DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE describes build-process docs & references the new spec.
4. DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL references GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC as behavioural authority.
5. Issue templates updated to reference GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC.
6. Architect / Implementer / QA GPT prompt profiles updated and aligned.
7. No duplicated or conflicting GPT behaviour rules remain in canonical docs.
8. All behavioural TODOs from Phase 0 have been resolved.
9. Andrew confirms there are no remaining rules that still live exclusively in chat.

If ALL items are satisfied → QA returns **PASS**.  
If ANY item fails → QA returns **FAIL** and creates corrective cards under P0.4.x.
