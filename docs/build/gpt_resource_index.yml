    # gpt_resource_index – Overview

    This file is the single source of truth for:
    - What project documents exist
    - What each document is for
    - Where they live in the repository

    Procedural rules for how GPTs load, use, and update these documents
    are defined in documentation_protocol.

    Architect, Implementer, and QA GPTs should treat this file as the
    directory of canonical docs. If a new canonical doc is created or an
    existing one changes meaning, this index must be updated.

    ## GPT Resource Load Paths

    Authoritative mapping from conceptual document names to on-disk paths.

    - This block is the single source of truth for where GPT resource files live.
    - When files are moved or renamed, update this mapping.
    - Other blocks (build_canon, tech_spec, etc.) may repeat the path as
      convenience metadata, but this mapping wins if there is a conflict.

    Tools or GPTs that need to locate a file SHOULD read `paths` in this block
    rather than hardcoding paths elsewhere.

    This list is the authoritative list of documents. If a document is named
    elsewhere but does not appear on this list, treat it as a retired document and
    ask Andrew what to do.

- id: gpt_resource_index.build_canon
  kind: reference

    ## build_canon

    ### Description

    Core philosophy, global AI behaviour principles, ontology of
    components, and high-level planning discipline.

    ### Usage

    - Used to ensure new work aligns with LillyCORE’s meaning and
      ontological categories.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant Canon section into chat.

- id: gpt_resource_index.roadmap
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## roadmap

    ### Description

    High-level phases (0..N) for LillyCORE evolution, defining when
    subsystems appear and their intent.

    ### Usage

    - Used to understand phase context and when subsystems are expected
      to exist.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant roadmap phases.

- id: gpt_resource_index.tech_spec
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## tech_spec

    ### Description

    Technical standards and environment details, such as:
    - Python versions
    - naming conventions
    - repository layout
    - script conventions
    - tooling and CI expectations

    ### Usage

    - Used to understand and obey technical constraints and environment
      rules.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant tech_spec section
      (e.g. Python, DB, scripts).

- id: gpt_resource_index.documentation_protocol
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## documentation_protocol

    ### Description

    Build/system documentation protocol defining roles, triggers, and
    procedures for updating canonical docs (build_canon, roadmap,
    tech_spec, documentation_protocol, gpt_resource_index)

    ### Usage

    - Used as the operational reference for when and how to update
      docs, which roles are responsible, and how QA verifies doc
      completeness.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the documentation_protocol build
      doc.

    ## GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX Block Index

    GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX is the directory of canonical build/system documents for LillyCORE.
    It lists what documents exist, what they are for, and where they live.

    ### Blocks in this file

    - `gpt_resource_index.overview`
      Purpose and usage of the resource index.

    - `gpt_resource_index.allowed_kinds`
      List of permitted block kinds for this file.

    - `gpt_resource_index.load_paths`
      Authoritative mapping from document names to on-disk paths.

    - `gpt_resource_index.build_canon`
      Entry describing BUILD_CANON (authority, philosophy, planning discipline).

    - `gpt_resource_index.roadmap`
      Entry describing the roadmap (phases and sequencing intent).

    - `gpt_resource_index.tech_spec`
      Entry describing TECH_SPEC (platform/tooling/layout constraints).

    - `gpt_resource_index.documentation_protocol`
      Entry describing DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL (doc governance and enforcement).

    ### Explicitly not defined here

    - Procedural governance (see DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL)
    - Runtime architecture and behaviour specs (appear in phase cards / future system docs)

- id: gpt_resource_index.qa_reference
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## qa_reference

    ### Description

    Reference document containing GitHub QA workflow conventions and CLI command templates
    used to create, move, and update QA cards and attach QA reports.

    ### Usage

    - Used by QA and Implementer roles when creating QA cards, updating QA results, or appending QA reports.
    - Used as a command-template library (copy/paste), not as a source of system behaviour.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant qa_reference section into chat.

- id: gpt_resource_index.registry_system
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## registry_system

    ### Description

    Documentation describing LillyCORE’s phase/card registry concept and any supporting automation
    intended to index phases/slices and support retrieval.

    ### Usage

    - Used when working on registry structure, registry scripts, or phase/slice catalog behaviour.
    - Not a replacement for GitHub cards; treated as an index/map layer only.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant registry_system section into chat.
