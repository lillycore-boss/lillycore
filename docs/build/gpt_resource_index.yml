      # GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX – Overview

      This file is the single source of truth for:
      - What project documents exist
      - What each document is for
      - Where they live in the repository

      Procedural rules for how GPTs load, use, and update these documents
      are defined in DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.

      Architect, Implementer, and QA GPTs should treat this file as the
      directory of canonical docs. If a new canonical doc is created or an
      existing one changes meaning, this index must be updated.

      ## Mandatory-load set

      ### Loader Contract
      
      Any GPT operating on LillyCORE MUST:
      
      1. STOP all reasoning and planning upon detecting this document
      2. REQUEST the full Mandatory Load Set if any item is missing
      3. INGEST and ACKNOWLEDGE all items in the set
      4. ONLY THEN proceed with any task, analysis, or modification

      ### Load Set
      
      - GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX (this index)
      - TECH_SPEC
      - DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL
      - BUILD_CANON

  - id: gpt_resources.load_paths
    kind: paths

      ## GPT Resource Load Paths

      Authoritative mapping from conceptual document names to on-disk paths.

      - This block is the single source of truth for where GPT resource files live.
      - When files are moved or renamed, update this mapping.
      - Other blocks (BUILD_CANON, TECH_SPEC, etc.) may repeat the path as
        convenience metadata, but this mapping wins if there is a conflict.

      Tools or GPTs that need to locate a file SHOULD read `paths` in this block
      rather than hardcoding paths elsewhere.

      This list is the authoritative list of documents. If a document is named
      elsewhere but does not appear on this list, treat it as a retired document and
      ask Andrew what to do.

      ## BUILD_CANON

      ### Description

      Core philosophy, global AI behaviour principles, ontology of
      components, and high-level planning discipline.

      ### Usage

      - Used to ensure new work aligns with LillyCORE’s meaning and
        ontological categories.

      ### Access

      - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant Canon section into chat.

      ## LILLYCORE_ROADMAP

      ### Description

      High-level phases (0..N) for LillyCORE evolution, defining when
      subsystems appear and their intent.

      ### Usage

      - Used to understand phase context and when subsystems are expected
        to exist.

      ### Access

      - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant roadmap phases.

  - id: gpt_resources.document.tech_spec
    kind: document

      ## TECH_SPEC

      ### Description

      Technical standards and environment details, such as:
      - Python versions
      - naming conventions
      - repository layout
      - script conventions
      - tooling and CI expectations

      ### Usage

      - Used to understand and obey technical constraints and environment
        rules.

      ### Access

      - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant TECH_SPEC section
        (e.g. Python, DB, scripts).

  - id: gpt_resources.document.documentation_protocol
    kind: document

      ## DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL

      ### Description

      Build/system documentation protocol defining roles, triggers, and
      procedures for updating canonical docs (`BUILD_CANON`, ROADMAP,
      `TECH_SPEC`, `MODULES`, `FEATURES`, `GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX`, and related
      conceptual docs).

      ### Usage

      - Used as the operational reference for when and how to update
        docs, which roles are responsible, and how QA verifies doc
        completeness.
      - MUST be loaded and read as part of the mandatory-load set before
        any reasoning, architectural planning, implementation, or QA that
        reads or writes canonical docs.

      ### Access

      - When needed, Andrew can paste the DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL build
        doc.

      ## Future Documents Placeholder

      Used as a placeholder for additional docs that may be added later, such as:
      - `NOTES_PLUGIN_SPEC`
      - `DREAM_ENGINE_SPEC`
      - Other subsystem-specific documents.

      When new docs are added, they should follow this pattern:
      - SECTION-style logical grouping
      - `name:`
      - `type:`
      - `status:`
      - `path:` (if applicable)
      - `description:`
      - `usage:`
      - `access:`
