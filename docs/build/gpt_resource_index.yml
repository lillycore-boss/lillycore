    # gpt_resource_index – Overview

    This file is the single source of truth for:
    - What project documents exist
    - What each document is for
    - Where they live in the repository

    Procedural rules for how GPTs load, use, and update these documents
    are defined in documentation_protocol.

    Architect, Implementer, and QA GPTs should treat this file as the
    directory of canonical docs. If a new canonical doc is created or an
    existing one changes meaning, this index must be updated.

    ## Mandatory-load set

    ### Loader Contract
    
    Any GPT operating on LillyCORE MUST:
    
    1. STOP all reasoning and planning upon detecting this document
    2. REQUEST the full Mandatory Load Set if any item is missing
    3. INGEST and ACKNOWLEDGE all items in the set
    4. ONLY THEN proceed with any task, analysis, or modification

    ### Load Set
    
    - gpt_resource_index (this index)
    - tech_spec
    - documentation_protocol
    - build_canon

    ## GPT Resource Load Paths

    Authoritative mapping from conceptual document names to on-disk paths.

    - This block is the single source of truth for where GPT resource files live.
    - When files are moved or renamed, update this mapping.
    - Other blocks (build_canon, tech_spec, etc.) may repeat the path as
      convenience metadata, but this mapping wins if there is a conflict.

    Tools or GPTs that need to locate a file SHOULD read `paths` in this block
    rather than hardcoding paths elsewhere.

    This list is the authoritative list of documents. If a document is named
    elsewhere but does not appear on this list, treat it as a retired document and
    ask Andrew what to do.

    build_canon: "docs/build/build_canon.yml"
    tech_spec: "docs/build/tech_spec.yml"
    gpt_resource_index: "docs/build/gpt_resource_index.yml"
    documentation_protocol: "docs/build/documentation_protocol.yml"
    qa_reference: "docs/build/optional/qa_reference.yml"
    registry_system: "docs/build/optional/registry_system.yml"

- id: gpt_resources.build_canon
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## build_canon

    ### Description

    Core philosophy, global AI behaviour principles, ontology of
    components, and high-level planning discipline.

    ### Usage

    - Used to ensure new work aligns with LillyCORE’s meaning and
      ontological categories.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant Canon section into chat.

- id: gpt_resources.roadmap
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## roadmap

    ### Description

    High-level phases (0..N) for LillyCORE evolution, defining when
    subsystems appear and their intent.

    ### Usage

    - Used to understand phase context and when subsystems are expected
      to exist.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant roadmap phases.

- id: gpt_resources.tech_spec
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## tech_spec

    ### Description

    Technical standards and environment details, such as:
    - Python versions
    - naming conventions
    - repository layout
    - script conventions
    - tooling and CI expectations

    ### Usage

    - Used to understand and obey technical constraints and environment
      rules.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant tech_spec section
      (e.g. Python, DB, scripts).

- id: gpt_resources.documentation_protocol
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## documentation_protocol

    ### Description

    Build/system documentation protocol defining roles, triggers, and
    procedures for updating canonical docs (`build_canon`, ROADMAP,
    `tech_spec`, `modules`, `FEATURES`, `gpt_resource_index`, and related
    conceptual docs).

    ### Usage

    - Used as the operational reference for when and how to update
      docs, which roles are responsible, and how QA verifies doc
      completeness.
    - MUST be loaded and read as part of the mandatory-load set before
      any reasoning, architectural planning, implementation, or QA that
      reads or writes canonical docs.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the documentation_protocol build
      doc.

    ## GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX Block Index

    GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX is the directory of canonical build/system documents for LillyCORE.
    It lists what documents exist, what they are for, and where they live.

    ### Blocks in this file

    - `gpt_resources.overview`
      Purpose and usage of the resource index.

    - `gpt_resources.allowed_kinds`
      List of permitted block kinds for this file.

    - `gpt_resources.load_paths`
      Authoritative mapping from document names to on-disk paths.

    - `gpt_resources.build_canon`
      Entry describing BUILD_CANON (authority, philosophy, planning discipline).

    - `gpt_resources.roadmap`
      Entry describing the roadmap (phases and sequencing intent).

    - `gpt_resources.tech_spec`
      Entry describing TECH_SPEC (platform/tooling/layout constraints).

    - `gpt_resources.documentation_protocol`
      Entry describing DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL (doc governance and enforcement).

    - `gpt_resources.placeholder`
      Temporary placeholder for future docs (should be removed once real doc entries exist).

    ### Explicitly not defined here

    - Procedural governance (see DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL)
    - Runtime architecture and behaviour specs (appear in phase cards / future system docs)
