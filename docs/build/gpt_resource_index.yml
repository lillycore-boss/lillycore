    # gpt_resource_index – Overview

    This file is the single source of truth for:
    - What project documents exist
    - What each document is for
    - Where they live in the repository

    Procedural rules for how GPTs load, use, and update these documents
    are defined in documentation_protocol.

    Architect, Implementer, and QA GPTs should treat this file as the
    directory of canonical docs. If a new canonical doc is created or an
    existing one changes meaning, this index must be updated.

    ## GPT Resource Load Paths

    Authoritative mapping from conceptual document names to on-disk paths.

    - This block is the single source of truth for where GPT resource files live.
    - When files are moved or renamed, update this mapping.
    - Other blocks (build_canon, tech_spec, etc.) may repeat the path as
      convenience metadata, but this mapping wins if there is a conflict.

    Tools or GPTs that need to locate a file SHOULD read `paths` in this block
    rather than hardcoding paths elsewhere.

    This list is the authoritative list of documents. If a document is named
    elsewhere but does not appear on this list, treat it as a retired document and
    ask Andrew what to do.

      docs, which roles are responsible, and how QA verifies doc
      completeness.

      doc.

    ## GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX Block Index

    GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX is the directory of canonical build/system documents for LillyCORE.
    It lists what documents exist, what they are for, and where they live.

    ### Blocks in this file

    - `gpt_resource_index.overview`
      Purpose and usage of the resource index.

    - `gpt_resource_index.allowed_kinds`
      List of permitted block kinds for this file.

    - `gpt_resource_index.load_paths`
      Authoritative mapping from document names to on-disk paths.

    - `gpt_resource_index.build_canon`
      Entry describing BUILD_CANON (authority, philosophy, planning discipline).

- id: gpt_resource_index.qa_reference
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## qa_reference

    ### Description

    Reference document containing GitHub QA workflow conventions and CLI command templates
    used to create, move, and update QA cards and attach QA reports.

    ### Usage

    - Used by QA and Implementer roles when creating QA cards, updating QA results, or appending QA reports.
    - Used as a command-template library (copy/paste), not as a source of system behaviour.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant qa_reference section into chat.

- id: gpt_resource_index.registry_system
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## registry_system

    ### Description

    Build-time reference for LillyCORE’s phase registry system:
    schema, file layout, and the automation contract for keeping registry
    data in sync with GitHub cards.

    The registry is optional and non-authoritative:
    - GitHub issues remain the source of truth for full card bodies.
    - Registry files are an index/topology map and may be generated by scripts.

    ### Usage

    - Used by Architect and QA roles to understand phase/slice topology at a glance.
    - Used by Implementers when maintaining registry tooling (sync/validation).
    - Used as the entry point for all registry conventions and expectations.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant registry_system blocks into chat.

- id: gpt_resource_index.build_github_reference
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## build_github_reference

    ### Description

    Build-time reference for managing LillyCORE’s main GitHub project board
    (columns, custom fields, and command templates).

    ### Usage

    - Used by Architect, Implementer, and QA roles when creating, moving, updating,
      or archiving main project cards.
    - Used as a tooling/automation template library (GitHub CLI), not as governance.

    ### Access

    - When needed, Andrew can paste the relevant build_github_reference section into chat.

- id: gpt_resource_index.block_loading
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## block_loading

    ### Description

    Procedural build-time system defining how GPTs request, load, and anchor
    documentation blocks instead of assuming full context.

    block_loading governs:
    - minimal initial context assumptions
    - explicit block requests by ID
    - canvas usage as persistent working memory
    - safe, auditable context expansion

    It does **not** define system behaviour or architecture.

    ### Usage

    - Used by Architect, Implementer, and QA GPTs whenever:
      - context is incomplete
      - rules, standards, or constraints may exist elsewhere
      - documentation blocks must be explicitly loaded before decisions

    - GPTs MUST follow block_loading rules when interacting with canonical
      build/system documentation.

    ### Access

    - Loaded via `gpt_resource_index.load_paths`
    - Retrieved using the block-loading retrieval script (`get_md.py`)
      or via Andrew-provided block excerpts.
