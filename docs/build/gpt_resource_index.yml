      # GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX – Overview

      This file is the single source of truth for:
      - What project documents exist
      - What each document is for
      - Where they live in the repository

      Procedural rules for how GPTs load, use, and update these documents
      are defined in DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL and DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.
      See docs/build/documentation_protocol.md and
      docs/documentation_governance.md.

      Architect, Implementer, and QA GPTs should treat this file as the
      directory of canonical docs. If a new canonical doc is created or an
      existing one changes meaning, this index must be updated.

      ## Mandatory-load set

      For any architectural reasoning, planning, implementation, or QA work
      on LillyCORE, GPT roles MUST load and read, at minimum:
      - GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX (this index)
      - TECH_SPEC
      - DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL
      - BUILD_CANON

      Additional rules:
      - DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL is the **procedural authority** for how GPTs
        behave when reading/updating docs.
      - DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE is the **conceptual authority** for doc
        layers, categories, and which docs are allowed or forbidden.

      ## GPT Resource Load Paths

      Authoritative mapping from conceptual document names to on-disk paths.

      - This block is the single source of truth for where GPT resource files live.
      - When files are moved or renamed, update this mapping.
      - Other blocks (PROJECT_CANON, TECH_SPEC, etc.) may repeat the path as
        convenience metadata, but this mapping wins if there is a conflict.

      Tools or GPTs that need to locate a file SHOULD read `paths` in this block
      rather than hardcoding paths elsewhere.

      - `NOTES_PLUGIN_SPEC`
      - `DREAM_ENGINE_SPEC`
      - Other subsystem-specific documents.

      - `type:`
      - `status:`
      - `path:` (if applicable)
      - `description:`
      - `usage:`
      - `access:`
