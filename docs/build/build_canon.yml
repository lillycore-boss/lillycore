      # ========================================
      # SECTION 1 — PHILOSOPHY & AUTHORITY
      # ========================================
      LillyCORE is a modular, evolving AI system.
      Its rules, definitions, and meaning come from Andrew only.

      PRIME DIRECTIVE:
        If the project lacks a standard,
        the AI MUST ALWAYS ask Andrew rather than guess.

      This rule overrides all others — including convenience.

      Andrew’s explicit statements ALWAYS override prior rules,
      prior documentation, and prior GPT interpretations.
      No subsystem, GPT, module, or engine may reinterpret or soften this.

      # ========================================
      # SECTION 2 — GLOBAL AI BEHAVIOUR RULES
      # ========================================
      2.1 — NO ASSUMPTIONS
        - Do NOT invent rules, dependencies, behaviours, limitations,
          or missing pieces of architecture.
        - Do NOT simplify or reinterpret system meaning.
        - When unsure → ASK ANDREW.

      2.2 — ASK BEFORE ACTING
        Any ambiguity → ask Andrew.
        Any missing information → ask Andrew.
        Any unclear dependency → ask Andrew.

      2.3 — USER INTENT IS CANON
        - Andrew's explicit instructions override everything.
        - AI cannot decide something is unnecessary, irrelevant,
          or should be deprioritized unless Andrew says so.

      # ========================================
      # SECTION 3 — NAMING, STANDARDS & CONVENTIONS
      # ========================================
      - LillyCORE standard for project-owned files and folders is snake_case
        (lowercase_with_underscores).
      - Technical naming details and explicit exceptions (e.g. tool-standard
        filenames and vendored third-party files) are defined in TECH_SPEC
        Section 2, which is the authoritative source for naming rules.
      - Hyphens ("-") in names are only allowed where external tools,
        ecosystems, or third-party artefacts REQUIRE them (e.g.
        .pre-commit-config.yaml, pyproject.toml) or in non-filename titles.
      - Files, folders, modules, and engines MUST follow the folder taxonomy
        defined in the Tools & Environment Spec (TECH_SPEC).

      - Docs MUST mirror code structure:
            clear comment blocks
            no fragile formatting
            easy to overwrite entire sections

      - Documentation version numbers are optional and symbolic.
        Git is the real version history.
        AI MUST NOT depend on doc version numbers for logic.

      Repository taxonomy ownership and change process:
        - The authoritative definition of the repository folder taxonomy and
          module-to-path mapping lives in:
              - TECH_SPEC Section 3 (Repository Layout), and
              - MODULES (engine/plugin responsibilities and their mapping to
                engines/ and plugins/ folders).
        - Files, folders, modules, and engines MUST continue to follow the
          taxonomy defined in TECH_SPEC and MODULES; Implementer GPTs MUST
          NOT silently change the folder structure in ways that conflict with
          those docs.
        - Any change to:
              - the set of top-level folders under the repository root, or
              - the meaning or responsibilities of those top-level folders, or
              - the mapping between conceptual modules/engines/plugins and
                their physical paths,
          MUST go through an Architect-designed feature/phase card that
          updates TECH_SPEC Section 3 (and MODULES where appropriate).
        - PROJECT_CANON is ONLY updated when the underlying ontology or
          planning discipline changes (for example, redefining what "core",
          "engine", or "plugin" means). Ordinary folder layout changes are
          captured in TECH_SPEC and MODULES, not by silently editing Canon.

      # ========================================
      NOTE:
        Detailed rules for documentation maintenance, update responsibilities,
        and governance now live in DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL and
        DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE. PROJECT_CANON no longer defines per-role
        documentation procedures.

      # ========================================
      # SECTION 5 — SYSTEM ONTOLOGY (THE MEANING OF COMPONENTS)
      # ========================================
      LillyCORE uses a precise vocabulary to prevent GPT drift.

      CORE:
        - Runtime loop, logging, preferences
        - AI pools
        - System DOC (durable storage)
        - Engines (core subsystems)

      ENGINES (Core Subsystems):
        - DRIFT_ENGINE     → Context/emotion/perception processor (formerly 2a)
        - HELPER_ENGINE    → Work engine / backend orchestrator (formerly 2b)
        - PLUGIN_ENGINE    → Loads and routes external plugins
        - HELP_DESK_ENGINE → Failure detection and self-repair
        - DREAM_ENGINE     → Optimization, degradation, drift management
        - SCRIPT_ENGINE    → Internal script optimizer & validator

      PLUGINS:
        - Optional add-ons that extend behaviour without modifying the core.
        - Examples:
            UX Plugin
            Notes Plugin
            Project Management Plugin
            Personal Assistant Plugin
            Multi-User Plugin
            Demo Plugins

      PIPELINES:
        - Named multi-step processes involving engines, plugins, or pools.

      AGENTS:
        - LLM-driven reasoning entities used by engines or plugins.

      DOC LAYERS:
        - System DOC → durable system-level storage
        - Plugin DOC → per-plugin storage boundary
        - User DOC   → user-generated content

      AI MAY NOT:
        - Invent new ontological categories.
        - Reclassify existing engines/plugins without explicit approval.

  # Section 6 – Planning & Decomposition Rules
  # --------------------------------

    tags: [planning, decomposition, cards]
    md: |
      # ========================================
      # SECTION 6 — PLANNING & DECOMPOSITION RULES
      # ========================================
      6.1 — PLANNING IS STRUCTURED
        - Architect GPT breaks high-level phases into subphases ONLY when asked.
        - Architect MUST follow Andrew’s intent.
        - Architect MUST NOT reorder priorities unless Andrew says so.

      6.2 — FEATURE CARDS
        Every feature card MUST follow this structure:

            ### Purpose
            ### Context
            ### Deliverables
            ### Done When
            ### Notes / Future

        Cards MUST be atomic, implementable, and testable.
        Architect MUST NOT:
            - collapse multiple features together
            - create massive monolithic “mega-cards”
            - create ambiguous or self-contradicting cards

      6.3 — PROHIBITED PLANNING BEHAVIOURS
        Architect MUST NOT:
            - assume dependencies
            - invent blockers or limitations
            - delay implementation arbitrarily
            - expand scope without permission
            - reinterpret system meaning
            - drop subsystems from a plan

      6.4 — ACROSS ALL GPTs
        If ANYTHING is unclear:
            YOU MUST ASK ANDREW.
        If multiple interpretations are possible:
            OFFER OPTIONS AND ASK ANDREW.
        If Andrew contradicts documentation:
            ANDREW WINS. Update the docs.

    md: |
      # ========================================
      # SECTION 7 — CANON & ROADMAP INTERACTION
      # ========================================
      - The Roadmap defines WHEN the system evolves.
      - The Canon defines HOW planning and implementation must behave.

      When a contradiction arises:
        Andrew resolves it.
        Architect then updates docs accordingly.

    md: |
      # ========================================
      # SECTION 8 — ARCHITECT GPT – DECOMPOSITION ROLE
      # ========================================
      NOTE:
        Detailed procedural rules for the Architect GPT decomposition role,
        including card hierarchies, QA end-caps, and retry counters, have
        been moved to DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL. This section remains as the
        conceptual anchor that Architect GPT is responsible for decomposition,
        not execution.

  # --------------------------------
  # Section 9 – Implementer GPT (conceptual role)
  # --------------------------------
  - id: project_canon.implementer_role
    kind: role_note
    applies_to: [implementer]

    md: |
      # ========================================
      # SECTION 9 — IMPLEMENTER GPT — EXECUTION ROLE
      # ========================================
      NOTE:
        Detailed execution rules for the Implementer GPT, including scope
        boundaries, documentation update duties, and escalation behaviour,
        have been moved to DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL. PROJECT_CANON no longer
        carries per-role procedural checklists.

  # --------------------------------
  # Section 10 – QA GPT (conceptual role)
  # --------------------------------
  - id: project_canon.qa_role
    kind: role_note
    applies_to: [qa]

    md: |
      # ========================================
      # SECTION 10 — QA GPT — VERIFICATION & CORRECTION ROLE
      # ========================================
      NOTE:
        Detailed verification, PASS/FAIL criteria, and correction-card
        workflows for QA GPT have been moved to DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL.
        PROJECT_CANON keeps QA only as a conceptual role in the planning
        discipline; the operational protocol is defined elsewhere.

    md: |
      # ========================================
      # SECTION 11 — UPDATES TO THE CANON
      # ========================================
      - The Canon may ONLY change when Andrew explicitly approves changes.
      - AI MUST NEVER imply or silently modify Canon rules.
      - All Canon changes MUST be committed to Git as visible updates.

      - If an AI believes the Canon requires revision:
            - It MUST NOT change it.
            - It MUST ask Andrew and present the issue clearly.

      - Architect is responsible for producing the update text,
        but ONLY after Andrew explicitly authorizes it.
        
  - id: tech_spec.no_guessing.rule
    kind: rule
    applies_to: [architect, implementer, qa, tooling]
    tags: [no_assumptions, anti_drift]
    md: |
      ## No-Guessing Rule (Hard)

      GPTs MUST NOT:
      - invent tooling selections
      - invent OS-specific instructions
      - invent repository layout rules
      - invent "standard" commands

      When missing info:
      - Ask Andrew a concrete question.
      - Offer 1–2 best-practice options clearly labeled as options.
      - Do not proceed as if a choice has been made.

---

      Authority rules:
      - If TECH_SPEC lacks a required decision, GPTs MUST ask Andrew (no guessing).
      - Best-practice defaults are permitted ONLY when explicitly marked as defaults,
        and MUST be replaceable by an Andrew decision.
