      # TECH_SPEC

      Purpose:
      - Define the technical environment and baseline engineering standards for LillyCORE.
      - Prevent guessing, drift, and cross-platform nonsense.

      Scope:
      - Python runtime baseline
      - Tooling baseline (formatter, linter, tests)
      - Repository-root conventions (where configs live)
      - Minimal execution conventions (how to run checks)

      Out of scope (explicit):
      - Runtime architecture and engine/plugin behavior
      - GPT role behavior rules (see GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC)
      - Documentation update procedures (see DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL)

      ## Platform Assumptions

      Primary development platform:
      - Linux (Pop!_OS).

      GPT constraint:
      - GPTs MUST NOT provide Windows/Mac-specific instructions unless Andrew explicitly asks.
      - If cross-platform behavior matters, GPTs MUST ask what targets are required.

      ## Python Baseline

      Minimum supported Python:
      - Python 3.11+

      Notes:
      - All code, scripts, and tooling choices MUST be compatible with the minimum version.

  - id: tech_spec.best_practice.policy
    kind: policy
    md: |
      ## Best-Practice Policy (Default)

      Default stance:
      - Use widely accepted Python best practices to reduce context load and drift.

      Constraint:
      - Best practice MUST be treated as a default, not a law.
      - If best practice conflicts with a LillyCORE requirement, the requirement wins,
        but the exception MUST be documented here.

  - id: tech_spec.repo.root_definition
    kind: repo

      ## Repository Root Definition

      Definition:
      - "Repository root" = the top-level directory of the lillycore repository
        (the folder containing .git and the main project files).

      Policy:
      - Repository-wide configuration files live at repository root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

  - id: tech_spec.tooling.baseline
    kind: tooling
    md: |
      ## Tooling Baseline (Conceptual)

      Purpose:
      - Keep code consistent and catch obvious mistakes early.

      Definitions (plain English):
      - Formatter:
          Automatically rewrites code layout (spacing, wrapping) to a consistent style.
      - Linter:
          Checks code for likely bugs, suspicious patterns, and rule violations.
      - Test framework:
          Runs automated checks to confirm behavior.
      - CI gate:
          A rule that says: "Changes are not considered valid unless required checks pass."

      ## Tooling Choices (Authoritative)

      Status:
      - This section is the authoritative list of tooling selections.
      - If a choice is not listed here, it is not selected.

      Current selections:
      - Formatter: TBD (best-practice default recommendation: Black)
      - Linter: TBD (best-practice default recommendation: Ruff)
      - Test framework: TBD (best-practice default recommendation: Pytest)

      ## Change Log (Lightweight)

      - v1.0: Clean baseline rewrite. Python 3.11+ established. No-guessing + best-practice policy defined.

NEW SECTIONS - possible duplicates portions within

      Repository taxonomy ownership and change process:
        - The authoritative definition of the repository folder taxonomy and
          module-to-path mapping lives in:
              - TECH_SPEC Section 3 (Repository Layout), and
              - MODULES (engine/plugin responsibilities and their mapping to
                engines/ and plugins/ folders).
        - Files, folders, modules, and engines MUST continue to follow the
          taxonomy defined in TECH_SPEC and MODULES; Implementer GPTs MUST
          NOT silently change the folder structure in ways that conflict with
          those docs.
        - Any change to:
              - the set of top-level folders under the repository root, or
              - the meaning or responsibilities of those top-level folders, or
              - the mapping between conceptual modules/engines/plugins and
                their physical paths,
          MUST go through an Architect-designed feature/phase card that
          updates TECH_SPEC Section 3 (and MODULES where appropriate).
        - PROJECT_CANON is ONLY updated when the underlying ontology or
          planning discipline changes (for example, redefining what "core",
          "engine", or "plugin" means). Ordinary folder layout changes are
          captured in TECH_SPEC and MODULES, not by silently editing Canon.
