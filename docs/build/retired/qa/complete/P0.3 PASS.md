All updates are clean and canonical.

✔ No conflicting definitions

Governance and protocol are fully aligned.
Hierarchy is consistent.
No contradictions across docs.

✔ No duplication

Canon, Tech Spec, Features, and gpt_resource_index now refer to Governance & Protocol rather than restating rules.

✔ Paths are correct

Everything matches tech_spec §3.

🧩 FINAL VERDICT

PASS.

PLAN

Phase / scope

Parent card: P0.3 – Establish Documentation Structure & Update Rules (Phase 0, documentation governance).

Subsystems touched:

Docs layer + build docs (PROJECT_CANON, roadmap, FEATURES, tech_spec, modules, gpt_resource_index).

Repository layout (tech_spec Section 3) for where docs live.

Key decisions already fixed by you

Use two separate files:

docs/documentation_governance.md – system-level doc types & hierarchy.

docs/build/documentation_protocol.md – build-only update protocol & GPT behaviour.

P0.3 should define a phase-agnostic, long-term framework (not just Phase 0).

Architects may propose new docs only when they truly SHOULD exist, and must push you for approval; runtime-generated artefacts (logs, etc.) are out of scope for P0.3 and can be defined later.

Build protocol must not duplicate rules already in Canon/Tech Spec/etc.; if it centralizes rules, the old copies should be removed and replaced with references, and the protocol doc must be added to gpt_resource_index and the “always-load” set.

Decomposition choice (per Canon §8)

P0.3 is small enough to express as ≤10 leaf-level tasks, so this invocation will produce only leaf-level Implementer cards (plus a QA end-cap), no extra Architect layer.

I’ll output:

P0.3.1–P0.3.7 → Implementer cards (leaf tasks).

P0.3.8 → QA card for the whole P0.3 bundle (required by Canon).

DOC — P0.3 CARD SET (LEAF-LEVEL)

Each card follows the Architect card structure from Canon §8.

P0.3.1 — Define Documentation Layers & Categories (System-Level Governance)

Type: Implementer
Phase: 0

Description

Define the core documentation layers and categories for LillyCORE, independent of specific files. Establish what types of documents the system may have, what their purposes are, and how they relate to each other. This forms the initial foundation of docs/documentation_governance.md.

Steps

Review PROJECT_CANON, tech_spec, gpt_resource_index, and modules to extract existing documentation-related constraints.

Define the system-level document categories (e.g., build docs, system docs, plugin docs, user-facing docs, runtime-generated artifacts).

For each category, specify purpose, intended audience, and ownership (Architect, Implementer, plugin owners, etc.).

Define which categories the system is allowed to have, should have, and must not have.

Create the initial content of docs/documentation_governance.md containing:

Purpose

Overview of documentation categories

Definitions for each category

Verify whether any conceptual overlap exists between these definitions and PROJECT_CANON §4; if so, record that awareness internally (no deliverable) and continue.

Present the resulting structure to Andrew for confirmation that the conceptual model matches intention.

Deliverables

New file: docs/documentation_governance.md with Purpose + Documentation Categories + Definitions.

Done When

The new doc exists with clear, system-level definitions.

Andrew confirms these definitions match his intent.

P0.3.2 — Define Documentation Hierarchy & Canonical File Roles

Type: Implementer

Description

Extend documentation_governance.md with a clear conceptual hierarchy and explicit roles for each major file (Canon, Roadmap, Tech Spec, Features, modules, gpt_resource_index), along with allowed future doc types.

Steps

List all existing build/system docs from gpt_resource_index.

Define each doc’s conceptual layer (system-level, build-level).

Describe each doc’s role (e.g., Canon = ontology + rules, Roadmap = evolution order, etc.).

Define explicitly which future doc categories are allowed (e.g., engine specs, plugin specs).

Add a “Documentation Hierarchy & Relationships” section to documentation_governance.md.

Ensure the hierarchy references tech_spec §3 for physical layout rather than duplicating it.

Check whether any doc-role clarifications overlap conceptually with existing PROJECT_CANON sections; if such overlap exists, simply note it internally (no deliverable) and continue.

Deliverables

Updated docs/documentation_governance.md with hierarchy and doc-role descriptions.

Done When

The hierarchy is written, clear, and consistent.

Andrew confirms the relationships match his intent.

P0.3.3 — Draft Build-Level Documentation Protocol (Roles & Triggers)

Type: Implementer

Description

Create docs/build/documentation_protocol.md defining rules for updating build docs, who updates what, and when GPTs must stop and ask Andrew, consolidating behavioural rules dispersed across the system.

Steps

Gather existing behavioural rules regarding documentation from Canon, Tech Spec, Features, and gpt_resource_index.

Identify procedural update rules appropriate for centralization.

Create docs/build/documentation_protocol.md with:

Purpose & scope

Roles (Andrew, Architect, Implementer, QA)

Update triggers

Ask-before-acting rules

Phrase the protocol so that it references other docs without duplicating them.

Check whether any procedural rules in the protocol overlap with PROJECT_CANON §4 or §8; if overlap exists, record the awareness internally (no output) and continue.

Present the protocol to Andrew for confirmation.

Deliverables

New file: docs/build/documentation_protocol.md.

Done When

Protocol exists, centralizes behavioural rules, and Andrew confirms accuracy.

P0.3.4 — Add Formatting & Replacement Standards to Documentation Protocol

Type: Implementer

Description

Extend the documentation protocol with formal rules governing section headers, block replacements, and the “ready-to-paste” standard.

Steps

Extract formatting rules from Canon and Tech Spec.

Add a “Formatting & Replacement Standards” section to documentation_protocol.md.

Specify rules for:

Section header patterns

Full-block replacements

Ready-to-paste updates

Handling partial refactors

Clarify that system docs must remain durable and easy to redraw.

Verify whether any remaining formatting guidance is duplicated in Canon; if so, simply note internally to avoid conflict on P0.3.6.

Present the updated protocol to Andrew.

Deliverables

Updated docs/build/documentation_protocol.md with formatting standards.

Done When

Formatting rules are clearly written and consistent with Canon and Tech Spec.

P0.3.5 — Define Rules for Adding New Documents & gpt_resource_index Integration

Type: Implementer

Description

Define system-level criteria and procedures for adding new docs and updating gpt_resource_index.

Steps

In documentation_governance.md, define criteria for when new doc types should exist.

In documentation_protocol.md, add procedural rules for proposing, approving, creating, and indexing new docs.

Clarify that runtime artifacts (logs, snapshots, etc.) are not governed by gpt_resource_index.

Ensure rules specify that all real docs must be added to gpt_resource_index.

Verify internally (no artifact) whether any part of FEATURES or gpt_resource_index already covers this and ensure non-duplication.

Present changes to Andrew.

Deliverables

Updated docs/documentation_governance.md.

Updated docs/build/documentation_protocol.md.

Done When

Both docs contain aligned conceptual + procedural rules for new documents.

Andrew confirms correctness.

P0.3.6 — Refactor Existing Docs to Remove Duplicated Rules

Type: Implementer

Description

Identify and remove duplicated documentation-governance or protocol content from existing system docs (Canon, Tech Spec, Features, gpt_resource_index), replacing them with short references.

Steps

Find duplicated procedural rules in PROJECT_CANON, tech_spec, FEATURES, and gpt_resource_index that now belong in governance/protocol.

For each, replace the duplicated text with a concise reference to the appropriate new doc.

Ensure that PROJECT_CANON retains only ontology + planning discipline content.

Ensure tech_spec retains technical constraints, not behavioural protocol.

Ensure FEATURES retains only feature card structure + template semantics.

Ensure gpt_resource_index remains the directory, referencing governance/protocol without restating them.

Where overlaps were previously identified during earlier cards, ensure they are resolved here (but no intermediate artifacts were required).

Present replacements to Andrew for approval before finalizing.

Deliverables

Updated:

docs/build/project_canon.md

docs/build/tech_spec.md

docs/build/features.md

docs/build/gpt_resource_index.md

Done When

All duplicated material is removed and replaced with references.

Andrew explicitly approves the changes.

P0.3.7 — Update gpt_resource_index to Register Governance & Protocol Docs

Type: Implementer

Description

Add DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE and documentation_protocol to gpt_resource_index and specify that they are part of the mandatory-load set.

Steps

Add new entries to gpt_resource_index for both documentation files.

Update the OVERVIEW and usage sections to reference these docs.

Clarify that GPTs must load the protocol doc before reasoning or planning.

Verify internally that the new index entries do not duplicate content from governance/protocol.

Present changes to Andrew.

Deliverables

Updated docs/build/gpt_resource_index.md.

Done When

Both documents are listed, paths are correct, and ingestion instructions are updated.

P0.3.8 — QA for P0.3 Documentation Governance & Protocol Bundle

Type: QA

Description

QA validates that P0.3.1–P0.3.7 meet specifications, that no ephemeral deliverables were created, and that all final docs form a coherent, non-duplicative documentation system.

Steps

Load the final versions of all affected docs.

Check each card’s Steps, Done When, and Deliverables for completeness.

Verify that governance and protocol docs do not conflict.

Ensure no temporary or intermediate artifacts exist anywhere.

Confirm that Canon, Tech Spec, Features, and gpt_resource_index contain no duplicated rules.

Verify all references are consistent and paths correct.

Deliver a PASS/FAIL decision.

If FAIL, produce corrective cards under P0.3.8.x.

Deliverables

QA PASS/FAIL evaluation.

Done When

QA returns PASS and Andrew confirms P0.3 is complete.
