      # lillycore_roadmap

      **FILE:** lillycore_roadmap  
      **ROLE:** High-level architectural evolution plan for LillyCORE  
      **VERSION:** v2.1 (Plugin/Engine terminology)

      ## SECTION: OVERVIEW

      This roadmap defines the ORDER in which LillyCORE’s subsystems come online.
      It is deliberately high-level and MUST NOT be treated as a task list.

      This version aligns naming with:
        - DRIFT_ENGINE (2a)
        - HELPER_ENGINE (2b)
        - PLUGIN_ENGINE (formerly Module Handler)
        - NOTES_PLUGIN (formerly Notes Engine)
        - Plugins vs engines terminology

      Architect GPT uses this to determine:
        - Which subsystems exist at a given point in evolution,
        - Dependencies between phases,
        - Scope boundaries for decomposition.

      QA GPT uses this to verify that implemented features align with the intended
      phase structure and subsystem sequence.

      Implementer GPT MUST NOT modify the Roadmap.  
      QA GPT MUST NOT modify the Roadmap; it only checks alignment of completed
      work to the intended phase.

      Outcomes of each phase represent architectural readiness,
      not code-complete deliverables.
