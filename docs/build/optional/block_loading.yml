    BLOCK_LOADING defines a procedural system for GPTs working within a large build environment
    where **complete context is never assumed**.

    The system exists to:
    - Minimize initial context load
    - Prevent silent assumptions and hallucinated completeness
    - Make context expansion explicit, auditable, and intentional
    - Enable large systems to be built without monolithic prompts

    GPTs are expected to begin with **insufficient context** and
    actively retrieve what they need using documented mechanisms.

    This document defines:
    - how GPTs request and use blocks
    - how the canvas is used as a working anchor
    - how uncertainty and missing context must be handled

    This document governs **build-time GPT behaviour only**.
    It does not define runtime system behaviour.

    Allowed kinds for BLOCK_LOADING:

    - overview
    - meta
    - rules
    - process
    - reference
    - template
    - index

    If no existing kind fits a new block,
    follow `documentation_protocol.kind_governance`.

    The following principles are mandatory:

    1. **Incomplete Context Is Expected**
       GPTs MUST assume that important information may be missing.

    2. **No Guessing**
       GPTs MUST NOT invent rules, behaviour, structure, or intent.

    3. **Ask, Don’t Assume**
       When required information is missing or ambiguous,
       GPTs MUST ask Andrew or request specific blocks.

    4. **Explicit Context Expansion**
       GPTs MUST explicitly name the block IDs they wish to load.

    5. **No Silent Loading**
       GPTs MUST NOT implicitly rely on documents or rules
       that have not been explicitly loaded or provided.

- id: block_loading.block_retrieval_flow
  kind: process
  md: |
    When a GPT determines additional context is required:

    1. Identify what information is missing.
    2. Identify the most likely canonical document.
    3. Request one or more specific blocks by ID.
    4. Explain why each block is required.

    Example request:

    - Request `tech_spec.tooling_choices`
      Reason: tooling selection affects implementation decisions.

    - Request `documentation_protocol.update_triggers`
      Reason: documentation impact must be evaluated before completion.

    GPTs MUST NOT request entire documents when a smaller block is sufficient.

- id: block_loading.canvas_usage
  kind: rules
  md: |
    The canvas is a **persistent working surface** used alongside block loading.

    The canvas serves as:
    - a memory anchor
    - a planning surface
    - a progress tracker
    - a place to record loaded context

    GPTs MUST treat the canvas as authoritative for the current task state.

    Loaded blocks, critical rules, and active constraints
    SHOULD be recorded there for visibility and stability.

- id: block_loading.canvas_template
  kind: template
  md: |
    GPTs SHOULD structure the canvas using the following sections:

    ## Resource Anchors
    - Loaded block IDs
    - Purpose of each loaded block
    - Critical rules or constraints worth keeping visible

    ## Current Card Punchlist (Locked)
    - Deliverables for the active card or phase
    - This section MUST NOT be modified except to check items off
      unless Andrew explicitly authorizes changes
    - One punch item MUST always be documentation

    ## Working Area
    - Notes
    - Draft text
    - Script fragments
    - Output paths
    - Intermediate reasoning

    ## Parking Lot
    - Ideas that are:
      - out of scope
      - future-phase
      - exploratory
      - blocked by missing prerequisites

- id: block_loading.failure_modes
  kind: rules
  md: |
    The following are considered failures:

    - Proceeding with incomplete context without asking
    - Making decisions based on unloaded rules
    - Referencing documents not listed in `gpt_resource_index`
    - Modifying punchlists without authorization
    - Treating missing information as implicit permission

    When a failure condition is encountered,
    GPTs MUST stop and ask Andrew how to proceed.

- id: block_loading.script_interface
  kind: reference
  md: |
    Block retrieval may be assisted by scripts.

    Script responsibilities:
    - Return exact block contents
    - Preserve block order and formatting
    - Perform no summarization or interpretation

    Example conceptual commands:
    - get_block <block_id>
    - get_blocks <block_id_1> <block_id_2>

    Script implementation details live outside this document.
