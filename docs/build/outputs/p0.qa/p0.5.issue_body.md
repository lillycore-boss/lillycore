CARD_ID: P0.10
CARD_TITLE: QA for P0 Technical Baseline (Cards P0.1–P0.9)

EXECUTOR_ROLE: QA

PHASE_CONTEXT:
  - Phase: P0
  - Slice: Technical Baseline Verification
  - Parent Card: P0
  - Purpose: Validate that all Implementer work from P0.1–P0.9 is complete, correct, consistent, and fully documented.

DELIVERABLES_SERVED:
  - P0.D60 – P0 Technical Baseline QA PASS/FAIL Report
  - P0.D61 – P0.10.x Corrective Cards (only if FAIL)

DESCRIPTION:
Perform full QA across all nine Implementer cards in Phase 0, ensuring that all technical decisions, governance rules, taxonomy definitions, documentation protocols, Canon updates, and TECH_SPEC structures are complete and consistent.  
Identify any remaining gaps, contradictions, missing documentation updates, or TODOs.  
Produce corrective cards if necessary.

INPUTS / PRECONDITIONS:
  - Completed outputs for:
        * P0.1 — Technical Baseline Decisions
        * P0.2 — Repository Taxonomy & Naming
        * P0.3 — Documentation Structure & Protocol
        * P0.4 — GPT Behaviour Rules (Canon)
        * P0.5 — Minimum Canon for Phase 1
        * P0.6 — Root-Level File Standards
        * P0.7 — TECH_SPEC Foundations
        * P0.8 — Phase-0 Meta Issue System
        * P0.9 — Phase Transition Criteria
  - Updated:
        * TECH_SPEC
        * PROJECT_CANON
        * FEATURES
        * GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX
        * documentation_governance.md
        * documentation_protocol.md
  - Requirement: No remaining TODOs in any Phase-0 document.

STEPS:
  - Step 1: Load and review the final outputs for P0.1 through P0.9.
  - Step 2: For each card:
              * Check all “Done When” conditions.
              * Confirm deliverables exist and match the spec.
              * Ensure no undocumented assumptions were introduced.
  - Step 3: Validate TECH_SPEC:
              * All P0.1 technical decisions present.
              * No TODOs remain in baseline sections.
              * Section structure matches P0.7.
  - Step 4: Validate documentation system:
              * Governance and protocol rules from P0.3 are present.
              * Canon references are aligned (P0.4, P0.5).
              * No duplicated rules remain across documents.
  - Step 5: Validate taxonomy & naming:
              * P0.2 decisions fully encoded in TECH_SPEC and Canon.
              * No contradictions across repo layout or naming rules.
  - Step 6: Validate root-level file standards from P0.6.
  - Step 7: Validate meta-issue tracking (P0.8) is documented and functional.
  - Step 8: Validate Phase-0 → Phase-1 transition spec from P0.9 exists and is complete.
  - Step 9: Decide PASS or FAIL:
              * PASS → provide a short summary report.
              * FAIL → generate corrective cards P0.10.x.

DONE_WHEN:
  - QA returns PASS.
  - All nine cards are confirmed complete with no contradictions.
  - TECH_SPEC contains all stable baseline decisions with zero TODOs.
  - Canon, FEATURES, and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX reflect all required updates.
  - Any required corrective cards (if FAIL) have been generated.

DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES:
  - None directly; QA only verifies and may trigger P0.10.x corrective updates.
