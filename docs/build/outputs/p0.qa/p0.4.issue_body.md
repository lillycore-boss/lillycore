Card ID: p0.5
Card Title: Retemplate Phase 1–11 GitHub Milestones into universal card template
Executor Role: Implementer

Phase Context:
Phase: p0
Slice: p0.5
Parent Card: p0.milestone_alignment

Deliverables Served:
- none

Description:
This card updates the existing Phase 1–11 GitHub milestones so that their Description
fields fully conform to the universal card template.

Each milestone description becomes a canonical Architect-level card body:
- using the universal template
- including Block Load Requirements
- including explicit scope boundaries

This card does NOT:
- change milestone titles
- change phase sequencing
- introduce implementation work

---

Block Load Requirements (Hard Gate)

Executor MUST NOT proceed until:
- all blocks listed below are loaded, OR
- Andrew explicitly waives the requirement for this card.

Have Andrew run the following before requesting anything else:
Bootstrap (minimum operating context for any task):
python3 docs/build/get_md.py --block \
  block_loading.overview \
  block_loading.script_interface \
  block_loading.canvas_usage \
  block_loading.operating_principles \
  gpt_resource_index.index \
  gpt_resource_index.load_paths \
  documentation_protocol.required_stop_on_missing_context

Required Blocks (task-specific):
- build_canon.feature_card_template
- documentation_protocol.no_placeholder_deferral
- roadmap.index

Inputs / Preconditions:
- Phase 1–11 milestones exist in GitHub
- Universal card template is authoritative

Constraints:
- MUST NOT create new cards here
- MUST NOT alter phase meaning or order
- MUST NOT perform implementation work

Steps:
1. For each Phase 1–11 milestone:
   - Replace Description with universal template
   - Set Executor Role to Architect
2. Preserve existing titles and phase names.
3. Ensure each description clearly states non-implementation scope.

Done When:
- All Phase 1–11 milestone descriptions use the universal template
- Block Load Requirements are present
- No milestone contains implementation instructions

Documentation Updates (implicit requirement):
(B) No documentation updates required.
Reason: GitHub milestone descriptions only.

Notes / Future:
- Phase 8 subphase cards are handled separately.

QA Hooks:
- QA will sample milestones for template completeness and scope correctness.
