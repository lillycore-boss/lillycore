Card ID: p0.2
Card Title: Canonicalise docs/system_canon.yml into block-structured registry doc
Executor Role: Implementer

Phase Context:
  Phase: p0
  Slice: p0.2
  Parent Card: p0.milestone_alignment

Deliverables Served:
  - none

Description:
  This card converts docs/system_canon.yml (under docs/, not docs/build/) into the canonical block-structured registry format used by LillyCORE documentation tooling:
  stable block IDs, explicit block kinds, the required canonical “overview” and “allowed_kinds” blocks, and an accurate system_canon.index block.

  This card is structural alignment only. It must not change the semantic meaning of canon beyond what is required to express the existing content in canonical block structure.
  It must not modify any files under docs/build/. It must not introduce new governance, new doc categories, or new “kind” values.

---
Reminder (non-authoritative): Due to model variance under partial authority, default to the most cautious interpretation of scope/permission; when in doubt, STOP and request the governing block(s).

Block Load Requirements (Hard Gate)

Executor MUST NOT proceed until:
- all blocks listed below are loaded, OR
- Andrew explicitly waives the requirement for this card.

Have Andrew run the following before requesting anything else:
Bootstrap (minimum operating context for any task):
  python3 docs/build/get_md.py --block \
    block_loading.overview \
    block_loading.script_interface \
    block_loading.canvas_usage \
    block_loading.operating_principles \
    gpt_resource_index.index \
    gpt_resource_index.load_paths \
    documentation_protocol.required_stop_on_missing_context

Required Blocks (task-specific; list exact IDs):
  - documentation_protocol.formatting_replacement
  - documentation_protocol.index_update_rule
  - documentation_protocol.qa_expectations
  - build_canon.invariant_no_silent_deferral

Notes:
  - If unsure which blocks exist, request *.index blocks first, then request specifics by ID.
  - Missing context is expected; inventing context is forbidden.

---
Inputs / Preconditions:
  - docs/system_canon.yml exists under docs/
  - Block loading tooling (docs/build/get_md.py) is operational
  - Phase 0 milestone alignment work is in progress; no other card is concurrently rewriting system_canon.yml

Constraints:
  - MUST NOT modify any files under docs/build/
  - MUST NOT invent new canon rules, new governance, or new doc categories
  - MUST NOT invent new block kinds; use only kinds already permitted/established for system-level docs once confirmed
  - Documentation changes MUST be block-level replacements (replace full md content per block), not line-level edit instructions
  - If the current system_canon.yml contains legacy structure that does not map cleanly to blocks, STOP and ask Andrew before restructuring meaning

Steps:
  1. Inspect the current docs/system_canon.yml content and enumerate the intended sections/topics it already contains.
  2. Define stable block IDs for each section without changing meaning.
  3. Convert the file into canonical registry-style block format (id/kind/md):
     - add required overview block
     - add required allowed_kinds block for this document
     - create/refresh system_canon.index enumerating all blocks
  4. Ensure markdown inside md fields follows documentation_protocol.formatting_replacement:
     - no file-level banners inside md
     - clean headings/lists
     - no legacy ASCII SECTION bars
  5. Provide paste-ready updates:
     - either full-file replacement content for docs/system_canon.yml, OR
     - a coherent set of full-block replacements that results in a correct final file

Done When:
  - docs/system_canon.yml is in canonical block structure (id/kind/md) with stable IDs
  - Required blocks exist:
    - system_canon.overview (kind: overview)
    - system_canon.allowed_kinds (kind: meta)
    - system_canon.index (kind: index)
  - system_canon.index accurately lists all blocks present in the file
  - No docs/build files were modified
  - No invented rules/kinds/categories were introduced
  - Any deferral is explicit and tracked (no silent stubs), per build_canon.invariant_no_silent_deferral

Proof / Execution Evidence (when required):
  - No runtime behaviour is introduced by this card; execution proof is not required.
  - If any validation tooling is run as part of this work, capture raw outputs under:
    docs/build/outputs/p0.2/

Documentation Updates (implicit requirement):
  - (A) Provide paste-ready replacements for docs/system_canon.yml blocks (or entire file), including an updated system_canon.index.
  - (B) No other documentation updates required, because this card only restructures docs/system_canon.yml into canonical format and does not change behaviour.

Notes / Future:
  - If semantic conflicts or “missing canon” are discovered during conversion, record them here and STOP for Andrew instruction rather than inventing canon.
  - Any follow-up work required must be scheduled as a new card/slice; no silent stubs.
