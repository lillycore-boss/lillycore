Card ID: p0.1
Card Title: Canonicalise docs/modules.yml into block-structured registry doc
Executor Role: Implementer

Phase Context:
  Phase: p0
  Slice: p0.1
  Parent Card: p0.milestone_alignment

Deliverables Served:
  - none

Description:
  This card converts docs/modules.yml (under docs/, not docs/build/) into the canonical block-structured registry format used by LillyCORE tooling:
  stable block IDs, explicit kinds, required overview and allowed_kinds blocks, and an accurate index block.

  This card is structural alignment only. It must not change system behaviour, must not invent new governance, and must not modify any docs/build files.

Reminder (non-authoritative): Due to model variance under partial authority, default to the most cautious interpretation of scope/permission; when in doubt, STOP and request the governing block(s).

Block Load Requirements (Hard Gate)

Executor MUST NOT proceed until:
- all blocks listed below are loaded, OR
- Andrew explicitly waives the requirement for this card.

Have Andrew run the following before requesting anything else:
Bootstrap (minimum operating context for any task):
  python3 docs/build/get_md.py --block \
    block_loading.overview \
    block_loading.script_interface \
    block_loading.canvas_usage \
    block_loading.operating_principles \
    gpt_resource_index.index \
    gpt_resource_index.load_paths \
    documentation_protocol.required_stop_on_missing_context

Required Blocks (task-specific; list exact IDs):
  - documentation_protocol.formatting_replacement
  - documentation_protocol.index_update_rule
  - documentation_protocol.qa_expectations

Inputs / Preconditions:
  - docs/modules.yml exists under docs/
  - Block loading tooling is operational

Constraints:
  - MUST NOT modify anything under docs/build/
  - MUST NOT invent new kind values
  - Documentation changes must be block-level replacements (full md field) per documentation_protocol.formatting_replacement

Steps:
  1. Inspect current docs/modules.yml and enumerate sections to become blocks with stable IDs.
  2. Convert file to canonical block structure (id/kind/md).
  3. Add required overview and allowed_kinds blocks.
  4. Add/update modules.index so it accurately enumerates blocks.
  5. Provide paste-ready full-block replacements (or full-file replacement if cleaner).

Done When:
  - docs/modules.yml is canonical block-structured (id/kind/md)
  - modules.index is present and accurate
  - required overview and allowed_kinds blocks exist
  - no docs/build files modified
  - no invented rules/kinds

Proof / Execution Evidence (when required):
  - No runtime behaviour claims introduced; proof not required
  - If any tooling is run, capture raw output under:
    docs/build/outputs/p0.1/

Documentation Updates (implicit requirement):
  - (A) Provide paste-ready replacements for any updated/created blocks in docs/modules.yml

Notes / Future:
  - If semantic conflicts are found, record them; do not “fix meaning” under this structural card.

QA Hooks:
  - Validated by p0.qa.1
