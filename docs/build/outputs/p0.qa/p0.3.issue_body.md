Card ID: p0.3
Card Title: Create docs/system_resource_index.yml as system-level documentation entry point
Executor Role: Implementer

Phase Context:
  Phase: p0
  Slice: p0.3
  Parent Card: p0.milestone_alignment

Deliverables Served:
  - none

Description:
  This card creates docs/system_resource_index.yml as the system-level entry point for GPTs and tooling to discover system-level (non-build) documentation under docs/.

  The file must be formatted as a canonical block-structured registry-style YAML doc:
  - stable block IDs
  - explicit block kinds
  - required overview and allowed_kinds blocks
  - an accurate system_resource_index.index block
  - a load_paths mapping that lists:
    - modules -> docs/modules.yml
    - system_canon -> docs/system_canon.yml

  This card does NOT:
  - modify any files under docs/build/
  - change the meaning of modules.yml or system_canon.yml
  - invent new governance or doc categories

---
Reminder (non-authoritative): Due to model variance under partial authority, default to the most cautious interpretation of scope/permission; when in doubt, STOP and request the governing block(s).

Block Load Requirements (Hard Gate)

Executor MUST NOT proceed until:
- all blocks listed below are loaded, OR
- Andrew explicitly waives the requirement for this card.

Have Andrew run the following before requesting anything else:
Bootstrap (minimum operating context for any task):
  python3 docs/build/get_md.py --block \
    block_loading.overview \
    block_loading.script_interface \
    block_loading.canvas_usage \
    block_loading.operating_principles \
    gpt_resource_index.index \
    gpt_resource_index.load_paths \
    documentation_protocol.required_stop_on_missing_context

Required Blocks (task-specific; list exact IDs):
  - documentation_protocol.formatting_replacement
  - documentation_protocol.index_update_rule
  - documentation_protocol.qa_expectations

Notes:
  - If unsure which blocks exist, request *.index blocks first, then request specifics by ID.
  - Missing context is expected; inventing context is forbidden.

---
Inputs / Preconditions:
  - docs/modules.yml exists under docs/
  - docs/system_canon.yml exists under docs/
  - docs/build/get_md.py block loading tooling is operational

Constraints:
  - MUST create the file under docs/ (not docs/build/)
  - MUST NOT modify any files under docs/build/
  - MUST NOT invent new kind values beyond what is permitted for this document once defined
  - MUST format changes as full block replacements (not line edits), per documentation_protocol.formatting_replacement

Steps:
  1. Create docs/system_resource_index.yml in canonical registry-style block format (id/kind/md).
  2. Add required blocks:
     - system_resource_index.overview (kind: overview)
     - system_resource_index.allowed_kinds (kind: meta)
     - system_resource_index.index (kind: index)
     - system_resource_index.load_paths (kind: reference or schema/rules as appropriate to the file’s allowed kinds)
  3. In load_paths, include:
     - modules: "docs/modules.yml"
     - system_canon: "docs/system_canon.yml"
  4. Add reference/description blocks for each system doc as needed so GPTs understand what they are for.
  5. Ensure system_resource_index.index enumerates all block IDs in the file accurately.

Done When:
  - docs/system_resource_index.yml exists and is formatted as canonical block-structured registry YAML (id/kind/md)
  - Required blocks exist: overview, allowed_kinds, index
  - load_paths includes correct mappings to docs/modules.yml and docs/system_canon.yml
  - system_resource_index.index is accurate and complete
  - No docs/build files were modified
  - No invented rules/kinds/categories were introduced

Proof / Execution Evidence (when required):
  - No runtime behaviour is introduced by this card; execution proof is not required.
  - If any tooling is executed as part of validation, store raw outputs under:
    docs/build/outputs/p0.3/

Documentation Updates (implicit requirement):
  - (A) Provide paste-ready full-file content for docs/system_resource_index.yml.

Notes / Future:
  - Adding additional system-level docs to this index must be done via explicit cards.
  - If conflicts appear between docs/ and docs/build/, record them and STOP for Andrew instruction (no invented resolution).

QA Hooks (if Executor Role is QA or card requires QA):
  - Validated by p0.qa.
