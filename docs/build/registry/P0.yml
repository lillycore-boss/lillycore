phase:
  id: P0
  name: "Phase 0 — Foundations & Tooling"
  milestone: "Phase 0 — Foundations & Tooling"
  order: 0

  description: |
    Phase 0 establishes the foundational environment, standards, and documentation
    structures required for all subsequent phases of LillyCORE. Before any functional
    architecture or implementation begins, the project must have a coherent, stable,
    and uniform base that both GPTs and humans can operate within reliably.

    This phase defines:
      • Documentation structures, formats, and ingestion rules GPTs must follow.
      • Technical standards required to begin programming (tooling, Python version,
        linters/formatters, testing baseline, etc.).
      • Core repository organization at a conceptual level (folder taxonomy, naming
        conventions, document layout).
      • Minimal PROJECT_CANON foundations required to begin Phase 1 cleanly.
      • Processes for maintaining and updating standards, docs, and canon as the
        system evolves.
      • Workspace preparation required for consistent execution, even if some
        elements are only defined conceptually here and instantiated later.

  inputs:
    roadmap:
      - "Roadmap definitions indicating the role and boundaries of Phase 0."
    canon:
      - "Minimal PROJECT_CANON subset required to start (system-wide rules and philosophy)."
    environment:
      - "Existing repository or workspace conditions to be normalized."
      - "Decisions on tooling requirements (Python version, formatter, linter, testing framework)."
      - "Documentation format structures required for GPT comprehension and update consistency."

  deliverables:
    - id: P0.D1
      name: "Documentation structures, formats, and ingestion rules"
      description: |
        Defined structures and formats for documentation, plus ingestion rules that GPTs
        must follow when reading or updating docs.

    - id: P0.D2
      name: "Technical environment and programming standards"
      description: |
        Technical standards required to begin programming, including tooling choices,
        Python version, formatter/linter rules, and testing baseline.

    - id: P0.D3
      name: "Core repository organization and taxonomy"
      description: |
        Conceptual repository layout defining folder taxonomy, naming conventions, and
        documentation placement.

    - id: P0.D4
      name: "Minimal PROJECT_CANON foundations for Phase 1"
      description: |
        The subset of PROJECT_CANON required to allow Phase 1 to begin cleanly, including
        system-wide rules and invariants that must already be in place.

    - id: P0.D5
      name: "Standards and documentation maintenance rules"
      description: |
        Rules and processes for how standards, docs, and canon are maintained, updated,
        and versioned as LillyCORE evolves.

    - id: P0.D6
      name: "Workspace preparation for consistent execution"
      description: |
        Definition of the baseline workspace and execution assumptions (folders, config
        files, initial tooling hooks) required for consistent behaviour across phases.

  constraints:
    - "Phase 0 must not introduce functional runtime, engines, or module logic."
    - "Definitions must remain high-level and avoid premature architecture for later phases."
    - "No module, engine, or functional code may be designed beyond establishing the environment they will later inhabit."
    - "All documentation and standards must be maintainable by GPTs and align with PROJECT_CANON and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX."
    - "Phase 0 outputs must not conflict with the roadmap; they act as prerequisites, not prescriptive architecture."

  structure:
    # Phase 0 is decomposed into multiple slices (P0.1–P0.10, including QA) and
    # potentially sub-slices (e.g., P0.4.1–P0.4.7). These will be added here as
    # they are normalized into the registry.
    slices:
      []

  qa:
    expectations:
      - "A clear, normalized Phase 0 definition exists and is sufficient for Phase 1 to begin."
      - "Foundational environment, documentation structures, and constraints are fully described."
      - "Phase 0 rules do not conflict with later roadmap phases."
      - "Outputs are understandable and usable by both GPTs and humans."
    notes: |
      QA for Phase 0 focuses on completeness and coherence of foundations, not
      functional behaviour. All later phases assume Phase 0’s rules and structures
      exist and are stable.
