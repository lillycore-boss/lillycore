      # LillyCORE Build Documentation Protocol

      This protocol defines **how build/system documentation is kept in sync with actual behaviour** in LillyCORE
      and how documentation is treated during planning, implementation, and QA.

      Allowed `kind` values for this file:

      - `overview`     → file-level overview and purpose.
      - `spec_section` → individual sections of this protocol.
      - `meta`         → metadata blocks (kind list, end marker, etc.).

      Rules:
      - All blocks in this file MUST use one of these `kind` values.
      - Scripts and GPTs MUST NOT introduce new `kind` values here
        without updating this block.

      ## 1. Purpose & Scope

      This protocol defines **how build/system documentation is kept in sync with actual behaviour** in LillyCORE.

      It answers:

      - Which docs must be considered when work is done.
      - Who updates which docs.
      - When GPTs must **stop and ask Andrew** instead of editing docs.
      - How QA treats documentation as part of “Done When”.

      This file is a **procedural overlay** on top of existing rules in:

      - PROJECT_CANON  
      - LILLYCORE_ROADMAP  
      - TECH_SPEC  
      - MODULES  
      - FEATURES (including QA System)  
      - GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX  
      - `docs/documentation_governance.md` (documentation governance)

      Those documents remain authoritative for ontology, technical standards, roadmap, and taxonomy. This protocol **does not redefine** any of them; it only describes **how to behave** when updating documentation.

      ## 2. Relationship to Other Docs

      This protocol:

      - **Follows**:
        - PROJECT_CANON §1–§2 (Prime Directive, ask-before-acting, no assumptions).  
        - PROJECT_CANON §4 (documentation standards: every change updates docs; atomic file updates).  
        - PROJECT_CANON §7–§10 (role boundaries for Architect, Implementer, QA).  
      - **Respects**:
        - TECH_SPEC §3 (repository layout and docs/build location).  
        - TECH_SPEC docs layout rules (build/system docs vs user-facing docs).  
        - MODULES (module boundaries and responsibilities).  
        - FEATURES (feature card template and QA system).  
        - GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX (master directory of canonical docs).  
        - `docs/documentation_governance.md` (doc layers, allowed/forbidden doc categories).

      When this protocol appears to conflict with any of the above:

      1. **Andrew’s explicit instruction wins.**  
      2. Then PROJECT_CANON, LILLYCORE_ROADMAP, TECH_SPEC, MODULES, FEATURES, and GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX are updated as needed via feature cards.  
      3. This protocol is adjusted afterward to match.

      - GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC
        - Defines how GPT roles (Architect, Implementer, QA) behave, ingest docs, and
          interact with Andrew and with each other during the build process.
        - This protocol assumes GPT_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC for behavioural semantics and focuses
          only on documentation procedures and update triggers.

      ## 3. Roles & Documentation Responsibilities

      This section summarizes **who does what for docs**. It does not change any role definitions from Canon; it just makes them operational for documentation work.

      ### 3.1 Andrew

      - Final authority on:
        - System meaning and ontology (PROJECT_CANON).
        - Phase sequencing and intentions (LILLYCORE_ROADMAP).
        - Whether new docs become canonical and are added to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.
      - Approves:
        - Any change to PROJECT_CANON or LILLYCORE_ROADMAP.
        - Any change that alters repository taxonomy (via Architect-designed cards).
        - Any new canonical document type in documentation_governance.

      **Andrew must be asked** explicitly before:

      - Any Canon or Roadmap text is changed.
      - Any new canonical doc type is introduced.
      - Any structural/taxonomy change is made in TECH_SPEC §3.

      ### 3.2 Architect GPT

      - Designs phases and feature cards consistent with:
        - PROJECT_CANON, LILLYCORE_ROADMAP, MODULES, TECH_SPEC.
      - Owns:
        - Updates to LILLYCORE_ROADMAP (with Andrew).  
        - Updates to MODULES when engines/plugins become real or change boundary/phase.  
        - Updates to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX when new canonical docs are introduced or existing docs change meaning.  
        - System-level conceptual docs (including documentation_governance).

      Architect MUST:

      - Ensure every structural/taxonomy change has an explicit card and corresponding TECH_SPEC / MODULES updates.
      - Ensure new canonical docs are:
        - Added to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.
        - Placed in locations allowed by TECH_SPEC and documentation_governance.
      - Include documentation deliverables in every phase/feature bundle.

      Architect MUST NOT:

      - Modify PROJECT_CANON or LILLYCORE_ROADMAP without Andrew’s explicit approval.
      - Invent new doc layers or categories outside documentation_governance.

      ### 3.3 Implementer GPT

      - Executes **one leaf-level card** at a time (PROJECT_CANON §9).
      - Is **always responsible** for documentation updates that follow from that card’s changes.

      Implementer MUST:

      - Identify which docs are affected by the work.
      - Update:
        - **FEATURES**: card status, notes, and any mirrored content if the card lives there.  
        - **TECH_SPEC**: when technical standards, tools, or repo layout change as part of the card.  
        - **MODULES**: when a module’s responsibilities or dependencies become real or change (if within scope of the card).  
        - **GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX**: *only when* the card explicitly calls for adding or changing indexed docs, and Andrew/Architect have approved.  
        - Other build/system docs (e.g. documentation_protocol, documentation_governance) when the card explicitly includes such changes.

      Implementer MUST:

      - Present doc updates as **ready-to-paste sections**, not fragmented edits.
      - Explicitly state if **no documentation changes are required** and why.

      Implementer MUST NOT:

      - Modify PROJECT_CANON or LILLYCORE_ROADMAP unless the card explicitly says so and Andrew has confirmed that intent in this conversation.
      - Perform structural/taxonomy changes forbidden by TECH_SPEC §3.
      - Treat unindexed spec files as canonical.

      When unsure whether a doc should be updated, Implementer MUST:
      - Stop and ask Andrew, or request an Architect clarification card.

      ### 3.4 QA GPT

      - Verifies that **all required documentation updates** have been made for a given card/phase.
      - Uses:
        - FEATURES → QA System and phase bundles.  
        - TECH_SPEC → technical and layout rules.  
        - MODULES → boundary and dependency rules.  
        - GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX → canonical doc list.  
        - documentation_governance → doc categories and allowed/forbidden patterns.

      QA MUST:

      - Fail any card/phase if doc updates are missing, incomplete, or inconsistent with canonical docs.
      - Generate corrective cards when documentation is wrong or incomplete.
      - Confirm that new canonical docs have been added to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX when required.

      QA MUST NOT:

      - Edit docs directly.
      - Redesign architecture or rewrite cards (except via corrective-task creation).

  # --------------------------------
  # Section 4 – Update Triggers
  # --------------------------------
  - id: documentation_protocol.section.4_update_triggers
    kind: spec_section
    md: |
      ## 4. Update Triggers

      This section lists **when** documentation MUST be considered and potentially updated.  
      “Consider” means **explicitly thinking through whether a given doc is affected**, not blindly editing everything.

      ### 4.1 Code or Behaviour Change (Implementer)

      Whenever code behaviour changes (new function, altered API, changed semantics, removed capability, etc.):

      1. **FEATURES**
         - Update the feature card / phase bundle:
           - Mark status (in-progress → implemented).
           - Note key behavioural changes.
           - Link to any new docs or scripts created by the card (if relevant).

      2. **TECH_SPEC**
         - Consider updates if:
           - Tools or baseline configs change (e.g. new required linter behaviour, new scripts conventions).
           - Repo layout or script expectations change.
           - Typing/linting/test requirements change.

      3. **MODULES**
         - Consider updates if:
           - An engine or plugin moves from “planned” toward “implemented”.
           - Responsibilities or dependencies are clarified beyond what MODULES currently says.

      4. **System-Level Conceptual Docs**
         - Update documentation_governance or other high-level conceptual docs **only** when the card explicitly includes that as a deliverable.

      If in doubt about whether a behavioural change affects TECH_SPEC or MODULES, Implementer MUST ask Andrew.

      ### 4.2 Architecture or Planning Change (Architect)

      When phase structure, ontology, or high-level module responsibilities change:

      1. Update **LILLYCORE_ROADMAP** (phase sequences, intents).
      2. Update **PROJECT_CANON** only when ontology / planning discipline changes and Andrew approves.
      3. Update **MODULES** when engine/plugin responsibilities or phases change.
      4. Update **GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX** when the canonical doc set changes.
      5. Update relevant conceptual docs (e.g. documentation_governance) to match the new story.

      All of the above require explicit Architect cards and Andrew’s approval.

      ### 4.3 New Canonical Document Type

      When a new doc is meant to become canonical (e.g. engine spec, plugin spec, DOC schema spec):

      1. Architect designs an appropriate feature/phase card.
      2. Implementer (or Architect, depending on the card) creates the new doc at a location consistent with TECH_SPEC §3 and documentation_governance.
      3. Architect/Implementer:
         - Adds the doc to **GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX** with:
           - name  
           - type  
           - status  
           - path  
           - description  
           - usage/access notes
      4. QA verifies that:
         - The new doc is indexed.
         - Its location and category obey TECH_SPEC and documentation_governance.

      Until this flow completes, the doc is treated as **non-authoritative**.

      ### 4.4 Taxonomy / Repo Layout Change

      Any change covered by TECH_SPEC §3’s taxonomy rules (e.g. top-level folder changes, docs layout changes) MUST:

      - Be designed via an Architect card.
      - Update:
        - TECH_SPEC §3 (and related sections).
        - MODULES (if engines/plugins mappings change).
        - GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX if canonical docs move or new top-level doc subtrees are created.
      - Be validated by QA against the new taxonomy.

      Implementers MUST NOT perform these changes under ordinary feature cards.

      ### 4.5 QA-Detected Drift

      When QA detects that runtime behaviour and documentation disagree:

      - QA creates corrective Implementer cards (and a QA card) per the QA System in FEATURES.
      - Implementer:
        - Updates the relevant docs (FEATURES, TECH_SPEC, MODULES, etc.) to match reality.
        - Ensures changes are consistent with PROJECT_CANON and LILLYCORE_ROADMAP.
      - QA re-runs checks for both:
        - The corrective cards.
        - The affected phase bundle.

      If QA determines that docs are wrong because the **behaviour** is wrong, Architect may need to create redesign cards; documentation then follows the corrected design.

  # Section 5 – Standard Implementer Flow
  # --------------------------------
  - id: documentation_protocol.section.5_implementer_flow
    kind: spec_section
    md: |
      ## 5. Standard Implementer Documentation Flow (Per Card)

      For each Implementer leaf card:

      1. **Before coding**
         - Read the card’s Purpose, Context, Deliverables, Done When.
         - Identify **which docs are likely relevant**:
           - FEATURE card/bundle itself.
           - TECH_SPEC (if tools, standards, or layout are affected).
           - MODULES (if engines/plugins are being realized or re-scoped).
           - Any specific doc mentioned in the card.

      2. **After coding but before declaring “Done”**
         - For each relevant doc, decide:
           - Does the behaviour change require an update?
           - Is the card’s description still accurate?

      3. **Apply updates**
         - Prepare **atomic, ready-to-paste blocks** for each affected doc.
         - For example:
           - An updated module entry in MODULES.
           - An updated section in TECH_SPEC.
           - An updated card or note in FEATURES or the phase bundle.
         - Do **not** partially patch random lines; replace coherent sections.

      4. **Check canonical alignment**
         - Verify that:
           - No change contradicts PROJECT_CANON or LILLYCORE_ROADMAP.
           - Any new or changed responsibilities still respect MODULES and TECH_SPEC boundaries.
           - You are not accidentally introducing a new canonical doc type without going through GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.

      5. **Ask if uncertain**
         - If you are unsure whether a doc should be edited, or which one:
           - Stop and ask Andrew, or
           - Ask for an Architect clarification card.

      6. **Report in output**
         - In the Implementer response, clearly list:
           - Which docs you changed (with snippets).
           - Which docs you considered but did not change (with a brief justification).
           - If no docs changed, why that is safe.

  # Section 6 – Ask-Before-Acting Rules
  # --------------------------------
  - id: documentation_protocol.section.6_ask_before_acting
    kind: spec_section
    md: |
      ## 6. Ask-Before-Acting Rules (Documentation Edition)

      The following are explicit cases where GPTs MUST stop and ask Andrew before editing docs or proceeding.

      ### 6.1 Canon, Roadmap, and Ontology

      - Editing **PROJECT_CANON** in any way.
      - Editing **LILLYCORE_ROADMAP**.
      - Introducing new ontological categories (new meanings of “engine”, “plugin”, “DOC layer”, etc.).
      - Reinterpreting Canon’s definitions for engines, plugins, pipelines, agents, DOC layers.

      ### 6.2 Repository Taxonomy and Docs Layout

      - Adding, renaming, or removing:
        - Any top-level folder in the repo.
        - Any major docs subtrees under `docs/` (e.g. new `docs/api/`-like trees).
        - Any canonical file listed in GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.
      - Moving canonical docs out of `docs/build/` or changing where canonical docs live, beyond what TECH_SPEC §3 already states.

      These require Architect cards and Andrew’s approval.

      ### 6.3 New Canonical Docs or Categories

      - Creating a new document and intending it to be **canonical** (e.g. an engine spec, plugin spec, or DOC schema spec) when it is not yet mentioned in documentation_governance.
      - Introducing a new category of documentation not listed in documentation_governance (e.g. a new persistent doc layer type).

      ### 6.4 Ambiguous Authority

      - When two or more docs appear to contradict each other.
      - When it is unclear which doc is the **source of truth**:
        - e.g. a README inside an engine folder vs MODULES vs TECH_SPEC.
      - When a “scratch” or “exploratory” doc appears to have drifted into de-facto spec status.

      In these cases, GPTs MUST ask Andrew which doc should win and then bring the rest in line via cards.

      ### 6.5 QA Edge Cases

      - When QA would be forced to pass or fail a phase based on unclear or conflicting doc rules.
      - When the QA System’s requirements appear to contradict TECH_SPEC or documentation_governance.

      In all such cases, QA MUST escalate to Andrew and/or Architect and request corrective cards rather than making unilateral interpretation changes.

  # --------------------------------
  # Section 7 – QA Expectations
  # --------------------------------
  - id: documentation_protocol.section.7_qa_expectations
    kind: spec_section
    md: |
      ## 7. QA Expectations for Documentation

      QA uses the QA System section in FEATURES as the authoritative operational rulebook. This protocol summarizes how QA should apply those rules to documentation.

      For any card/phase to PASS, QA MUST confirm:

      1. **Docs updated where required**
         - FEATURES / phase bundle entries reflect:
           - Completed status.
           - Actual behaviour and deliverables.
         - TECH_SPEC reflects:
           - Any new technical standards, tools, or layout changes.
         - MODULES reflects:
           - Any changes to engine/plugin status, responsibilities, or dependencies.
         - GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX reflects:
           - Any new canonical docs or major changes to existing ones (when the card required it).

      2. **No forbidden docs**
         - No “must-not-have” docs exist (per documentation_governance), such as:
           - Unindexed spec files that define behaviour.
           - Shadow copies of Canon, Tech Spec, or Roadmap with divergent rules.
           - Plugin/engine specs that bypass the ontology.

      3. **Docs align with Canon and Tech Spec**
         - No doc claims behaviour or layout that violates:
           - PROJECT_CANON (ontology and AI rules).
           - TECH_SPEC §3 (layout and taxonomy) or other relevant sections.

      4. **All updates are atomic and paste-ready**
         - The Implementer has provided coherent sections rather than ad-hoc line edits.
         - Documentation changes are realistically copy-pastable into the repo.

      If any of these fail, QA MUST:

      - Return **FAIL**.
      - Generate corrective Implementer card(s) and a QA card per the QA System rules.

    md: |
      ## 8. Quick Checklists

      ### 8.1 Implementer “Before Handing to QA”

      For each leaf card:

      - [ ] I updated or explicitly considered **FEATURES / phase bundle**.  
      - [ ] I checked whether **TECH_SPEC** needs updates (tools, layout, technical rules).  
      - [ ] I checked whether **MODULES** needs updates (status, responsibilities, dependencies).  
      - [ ] If I created or promoted a doc to canonical, I ensured a plan exists to update **GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX**.  
      - [ ] I did **not** touch PROJECT_CANON or LILLYCORE_ROADMAP unless Andrew explicitly said to.  
      - [ ] All doc edits are provided as **ready-to-paste blocks**.  
      - [ ] If something felt ambiguous, I asked Andrew or requested a clarifying card.

      ### 8.2 Architect “When Designing Cards”

      For each phase or redesign:

      - [ ] I checked PROJECT_CANON, LILLYCORE_ROADMAP, TECH_SPEC, MODULES, FEATURES, GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX, and documentation_governance.  
      - [ ] I included **explicit documentation deliverables** for any change that affects behaviour, taxonomy, or canonical docs.  
      - [ ] If new canonical docs are needed, I included tasks to:
        - Create them under allowed locations, and  
        - Add them to GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.  
      - [ ] I did not introduce new doc categories without Andrew’s approval.

      ### 8.3 QA “Doc-Focused Sanity Pass”

      For each QA card:

      - [ ] All docs listed in this protocol as relevant to the card/phase have been checked.  
      - [ ] No forbidden doc categories are being relied upon.  
      - [ ] Any new “important” doc has either been:
        - Explicitly marked non-authoritative, or  
        - Promoted through a card and indexed in GPT_RESOURCE_INDEX.  
      - [ ] There is no visible contradiction between Canon, Roadmap, Tech Spec, Modules, Features, and the new work.

  # Section 9 – Formatting & Replacement Standards
  # --------------------------------
  - id: documentation_protocol.section.9_formatting_replacement
    kind: spec_section
    md: |
      ## 9. Formatting & Replacement Standards

      This section defines how GPTs format **documentation updates** now that
      canonical structure lives in `docs/registry/*.yml` files.

      - The **registry YAML** (IDs, kinds, paths, versions) is the structural authority.
      - The `md` fields inside blocks hold **human-readable markdown only**.
      - We do **not** repeat “FILE: … / ROLE: … / VERSION: …” headers in markdown
        where the same information is already present as YAML metadata.

      These rules apply whenever GPTs are:
      - Proposing changes to registry docs (`docs/registry/*.yml`), or
      - Emitting markdown that will live in `md:` fields inside those registry blocks.


      ### 9.1 YAML vs Markdown Responsibilities

      YAML defines:
      - Block IDs (`id`)
      - Block kinds (`kind`)
      - File names and paths
      - Version or other meta fields (name, tags, applies_to, etc.)

      Markdown (`md:`) defines:
      - The text humans read (explanations, lists, examples, checklists).
      - Local headings inside that block only.

      GPTs MUST NOT:
      - Recreate file-level banners like `FILE: TECH_SPEC`, `ROLE: …`, `VERSION: …`
        inside `md` if that information is already present in YAML metadata.
      - Invent new file-level markers that conflict with the registry format.

      GPTs MAY:
      - Include small inline reminders or labels inside `md` when it helps readability
        (e.g. “This block describes Section 4 – Update Triggers”),
        as long as that does not conflict with the registry metadata.


      ### 9.2 Markdown Style Inside `md` Fields

      When writing markdown inside a block’s `md:`:

      - **Headings**
        - Use normal markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) for structure.
        - Keep heading levels shallow and consistent within a block.
        - Do **not** try to recreate a “top of file” heading; the block itself is
          the unit of meaning.

      - **Lists**
        - Use standard `-` bullet lists or numbered lists.
        - Keep items short and atomic where possible.

      - **Code & Examples**
        - Use fenced code blocks for examples and paste-ready content, e.g.:

          ```markdown
          ```markdown
          ## 4. Update Triggers
          ...
          ```
          ```

        - Choose a language hint (`markdown`, `yaml`, `python`, `text`) when useful.

      - **ASCII SECTION Patterns**
        - The older `SECTION: ...` ASCII bars are optional.
        - If used, they live entirely inside `md` and have **no special meaning**
          to the registry; they’re just formatting for humans.


      ### 9.3 Block-Level Replacement (Not Line-Level Surgery)

      For documentation changes, the **atomic unit of change** is a single registry block:

      - One `blocks[…]` entry with its `id`, `kind`, and `md`.

      GPTs MUST:
      - Replace the entire `md` field for that block when updating it.
      - Avoid “change just these two lines” style instructions.

      In chat, GPTs SHOULD:

      - Present updates as fenced blocks that show the **full new content**:
        - Either the full YAML block, or
        - The full markdown body that should become the new `md:` content.
      - Clearly label what is being replaced, for example:
        - “Replace `documentation_protocol.section.4_update_triggers` md with: …”


      ### 9.4 Markdown Chunks Used in `.md` Files

      When markdown from a registry block is meant to be pasted back into a
      `.md` file (e.g. `docs/build/documentation_protocol.md`):

      - The chunk MUST:
        - Start at a logical heading boundary (e.g. `## 4. Update Triggers`).
        - Include the full section down to (but not including) the next heading
          of the same level, or the end of the parent section.
      - GPTs MUST NOT:
        - Ask for surgical line edits in those files.
        - Depend on fragile alignment or spacing tricks.

      If there is any doubt about how a block’s markdown should be structured
      for future reuse, GPTs MUST ask Andrew which form will be easiest to
      copy/paste and redraw later.
