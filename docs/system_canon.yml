    LillyCORE uses a precise vocabulary to prevent GPT drift.

    CORE:
      - Runtime loop, logging, preferences
      - AI pools
      - System DOC (durable storage)
      - Engines (core subsystems)

    ENGINES (Core Subsystems):
      - DRIFT_ENGINE     → Context/emotion/perception processor (formerly 2a)
      - HELPER_ENGINE    → Work engine / backend orchestrator (formerly 2b)
      - PLUGIN_ENGINE    → Loads and routes external plugins
      - HELP_DESK_ENGINE → Failure detection and self-repair
      - DREAM_ENGINE     → Optimization, degradation, drift management
      - SCRIPT_ENGINE    → Internal script optimizer & validator

    PLUGINS:
      - Optional add-ons that extend behaviour without modifying the core.
      - Examples:
          UX Plugin
          Notes Plugin
          Project Management Plugin
          Personal Assistant Plugin
          Multi-User Plugin
          Demo Plugins

    PIPELINES:
      - Named multi-step processes involving engines, plugins, or pools.

    AGENTS:
      - LLM-driven reasoning entities used by engines or plugins.

    DOC LAYERS:
      - System DOC → durable system-level storage
      - Plugin DOC → per-plugin storage boundary
      - User DOC   → user-generated content
