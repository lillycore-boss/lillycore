    SYSTEM_RESOURCE_INDEX is the system-level entry point for discovering **non-build** documentation under `docs/`.

    This registry is intended for:
    - GPTs and tools that need to find system-level documentation without scanning the repo
    - Humans who need a single map of the system-level docs and what they are for

    Scope:
    - Includes only documentation that lives under `docs/` (not `docs/build/`).
    - Acts as an entry point and locator; it does not redefine or govern the meaning of the referenced docs.

    Non-scope:
    - Build-time governance and protocols (see `docs/build/` resources instead).

    Notes:
    - This file is a small registry. Prefer `reference` blocks for individual entries.
    - Do not introduce additional kinds in this file without an explicit governing card.

    ## system_resource_index.load_paths

    ## System Resource Load Paths

    Authoritative mapping from conceptual system document names to on-disk paths.

    Tools or GPTs that need to locate a system-level doc SHOULD read this mapping
    rather than hardcoding paths elsewhere.

    modules: "docs/modules.yml"
    system_canon: "docs/system_canon.yml"
    contracts: "docs/contracts.yml"

- id: system_resource_index.modules
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## modules

    Path: `docs/modules.yml`

    `modules.yml` describes the system's module catalogue at the system-doc level.
    It exists so tools and GPTs can discover what modules exist and where their
    documentation lives, without needing build-time documentation context.

    This index file does not modify or reinterpret `modules.yml`; it only points to it.

- id: system_resource_index.system_canon
  kind: reference
  md: |
    ## system_canon

    Path: `docs/system_canon.yml`

    `system_canon.yml` contains the system-level canon: the authoritative narrative
    and constraints for the system itself (non-build), as distinct from build-time
    governance under `docs/build/`.

    This index file does not modify or reinterpret `system_canon.yml`; it only points to it.
