      **FILE:** modules  
      **ROLE:** Overview of major engines and plugins in LillyCORE  

      > NOTE: This file tracks BIG PIECES of the system, not individual features.

      ## SECTION: OVERVIEW

      In LillyCORE, we distinguish between:

        CORE ENGINES (core modules):
          - DRIFT_ENGINE       (2a) front/context/emotion
          - HELPER_ENGINE      (2b) work engine / helper
          - MODULE_ENGINE      module / plugin management
          - HELP_DESK_ENGINE   stability / auto-fix
          - DREAM_ENGINE       offline reasoning/maintenance
          - SCRIPT_ENGINE      script optimisation + self-maintenance

        PLUGINS (add-on modules):
          - UX_INTERFACE
          - PROJECT_MANAGEMENT
          - PERSONAL_ASSISTANT
          - NOTES_PLUGIN       (demo/testbed)
          - MULTI_USER
          - DEMOS_AND_CORP
          - Any future “extra capability” systems

      **Engines:**

      - Core of how Lilly thinks, works, and maintains itself.

      **Plugins:**

      - Built on top of engines.
      - NOT part of the core runtime.

      **Implementation layout (folder mapping):**

      - All engines are implemented under:

        `engines/<engine_name>/`

        e.g.:

        - `engines/drift_engine/`
        - `engines/helper_engine/`
        - `engines/plugin_engine/`
        - `engines/helpdesk_engine/`
        - `engines/dream_engine/`
        - `engines/script_engine/`

      - All plugins are implemented under:

        `plugins/<plugin_name>/`

        e.g.:

        - `plugins/notes_plugin/`
        - `plugins/ux_interface/`
        - `plugins/project_management/`
        - `plugins/personal_assistant/`
        - `plugins/multi_user/`
        - `plugins/demos_and_corp/`

      - The folder taxonomy for these modules is defined in tech_spec Section 3
        and MUST be kept in sync with this overview.

      **Dependency and boundary rules:**

      - Engines may depend on:
          `core/` (runtime loop, logging, AI pools, System DOC),
          other engines where explicitly listed under "dependencies"
          in this modules file.
      - Engines MUST NOT import plugins directly; they see plugins only through
        PLUGIN_ENGINE / MODULE_ENGINE registries and capability interfaces.

      - Plugins may depend on:
          `core/` and engines/, as clients of those APIs.
      - Plugins MUST NOT:
          be imported directly by `core/` or engines/ (except via plugin
          registration and routing interfaces),
          own or redefine System DOC schemas (plugins operate within the
          DOC layer boundaries defined by core/System DOC).

      This file answers:

      - What engines and plugins exist?
      - When do they appear (which phase)?
      - What are they responsible for?
      - What do they depend on?

      Architect GPT can use this to:

      - Keep subsystems distinct.
      - Place new features in the right engine or plugin.

      QA GPT can use this to verify that implemented work respects module boundaries
      and responsibilities.

      Implementer GPT can use this for:

      - Context when touching specific engines/plugins.

      ## SECTION: ENTRY TEMPLATE

      Use this pattern for each entry:

      ```text
        type: core | engine | plugin | ui | infra
        phase: <roadmap phase number>
        status: planned | in-progress | implemented

        summary:
          Short description of what this owns.

        responsibilities:
          - bullet
          - bullet

        dependencies:
          - list engines/plugins/layers it needs

        notes:
          - any important constraints or decisions
      ```

  - id: modules.core_runtime
    kind: module
    md: |
      type: core
      phase: 1
      status: planned

      summary:

        - Load and apply user preferences.
        - Coordinate low-level use of AI pools.

      dependencies:
        - None (foundational).

      notes:
        - In future, DRIFT_ENGINE and HELPER_ENGINE may run in separate processes
          or on separate machines.
        - Do NOT bake in assumptions that all engines are forever fused.

  - id: modules.ai_pools
    kind: module
    md: |
      type: core
      phase: 2
      status: planned

      summary:

      responsibilities:
        - Provide conversational, deterministic, and worker pools.
        - Wrap LLM calls with retries, timeouts, and envelopes.

      dependencies:
        - CORE_RUNTIME

      notes:
        - Backend choices (OpenAI, local models, etc.) are defined elsewhere.

  - id: modules.system_doc
    kind: module
    md: |
      type: core
      phase: 3
      status: planned

        - Manage snapshots and final outputs (pdf/txt/img routing).

      dependencies:
        - CORE_RUNTIME

      notes:
        - Actual DB/storage engine is defined in tech_spec / future design.
        - Engines and plugins build on this.

  - id: modules.drift_engine
    kind: module
    md: |
      type: engine
      phase: 5
      status: planned

      summary:
        2a – "Lilly the Person".

      responsibilities:
        - Classify content as work / personal / ephemeral.
        - Apply emotional weights to experiences and memories.
        - Maintain personal memory entries.
        - Track ephemeral context (recent messages, tone).
        - Produce thread/context summaries as input to HELPER_ENGINE.

      dependencies:
        - SYSTEM_DOC
        - NOTES_PLUGIN (for testing / early flows)

      notes:
        - Name "DRIFT_ENGINE" reflects its role in managing emotional/contextual drift.

  - id: modules.helper_engine
    kind: module
    md: |
      type: engine
      phase: 6
      status: planned

        - Call backend AIs or stubs.
        - Return structured results.
        - Log work events.

      dependencies:
        - AI_POOLS
        - DRIFT_ENGINE
