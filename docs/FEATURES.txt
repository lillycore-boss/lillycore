# ========================================
# FILE: FEATURES
# ROLE: Feature card structure + optional mirror of key work items
# NOTE: GitHub Issues / Project Board is the primary tracker.
# ========================================


# ========================================
# SECTION: OVERVIEW
# ========================================
# This file defines:
#   - The standard shape of a LillyCORE feature card.
#   - How GPTs should THINK about features.
#   - (Optionally) a small set of important feature cards mirrored
#     from GitHub for quick reference.
#
# Primary source of truth for actual work items:
#   - GitHub Issues / Project Board (owned by Andrew).
#
# This file does NOT need to contain every feature.
# It can be:
#   - Just the template, OR
#   - Template + a curated subset of important cards.


# ========================================
# SECTION: SOURCE OF TRUTH
# ========================================
# Canonical feature list:
#   - GitHub Project Board and Issues.
#
# For GPTs:
#   - Architect GPT:
#       - Designs feature cards logically and may propose card content.
#       - MUST NOT assume GitHub state; Andrew decides what actually gets created.
#   - Implementer GPT:
#       - Only works from feature cards explicitly pasted into chat.
#
# When a GPT needs a feature card, it MUST ask Andrew to:
#   - Paste the GitHub issue body, OR
#   - Paste the corresponding section from this FEATURES file if you keep mirrors.
#
# Example GPT request:
#   "Please paste the GitHub card body or FEATURES entry for F-XXX so I can implement it."


# ========================================
# SECTION: FEATURE CARD TEMPLATE
# ========================================
# All features for LillyCORE SHOULD use this structure.
#
# ID:
#   - A short identifier like F-001, F-002, etc.
#   - Optionally match the GitHub issue number or have a separate scheme.
#
# Template:
#
#   ID: F-XXX
#   Title: <short feature name>
#   Phase: <roadmap phase number(s)>
#   Engine/Plugin: <e.g. DRIFT_ENGINE, HELPER_ENGINE, NOTES_PLUGIN, etc.>
#   GitHub: <optional link or issue number>
#   Status: planned | in-progress | implemented | blocked
#
#   Purpose:
#       - Why this feature exists.
#
#   Context:
#       - Where it fits in the roadmap and module/engine layout.
#       - Any relevant background information.
#
#   Deliverables:
#       - Bullet list of concrete outputs (code, behaviour, docs).
#
#   Done When:
#       - Clear, checkable conditions for "this is complete".
#
#   Notes / Future:
#       - Follow-ups.
#       - Risks.
#       - Ideas for later expansion.
#
# GPT RULE:
#   - Architect MUST use this shape when proposing or refining features.
#   - Implementer MUST NOT silently change these semantics.


# ========================================
# SECTION: GPT INTERACTION RULES
# ========================================
# Architect GPT:
#   - May propose new feature cards in this format.
#   - MUST label them clearly with an ID and Phase.
#   - MUST ask Andrew whether to:
#       - Add them to GitHub,
#       - Add them to this file,
#       - Or treat them as exploratory only.
#
# Implementer GPT:
#   - MUST ask Andrew for the card text before implementing.
#   - MUST NOT:
#       - Infer missing fields.
#       - Invent "Done When" criteria.
#       - Change the Purpose/Context without approval.
#
# When in doubt:
#   - ASK Andrew:
#       "Is this card tracked in GitHub, FEATURES, or both?"


# ========================================
# SECTION: EXAMPLE FEATURE CARD (PLACEHOLDER)
# ========================================
# This is an example only. It does NOT represent current real work
# unless Andrew chooses to adopt it.
#
#   ID: F-000
#   Title: Example Feature Card Template
#   Phase: 0
#   Engine/Plugin: (none)
#   GitHub: (optional)
#   Status: planned
#
#   Purpose:
#       - Demonstrate the feature card structure for LillyCORE.
#
#   Context:
#       - Used by GPTs and Andrew as a reference when creating real cards.
#
#   Deliverables:
#       - This template stored in FEATURES.
#       - Shared understanding of card fields.
#
#   Done When:
#       - Architect and Implementer GPTs consistently follow this structure.
#
#   Notes / Future:
#       - Replace this with real feature examples once the system matures.


# ========================================
# SECTION: OPTIONAL MIRRORED FEATURES
# ========================================
# Andrew may choose to mirror a few especially important features here.
# For example:
#   - Core runtime loop
#   - First version of DRIFT_ENGINE
#   - First version of HELPER_ENGINE
#   - First UX plugin
#
# For each mirrored feature:
#   - Copy the GitHub card content
#   - Normalize it into the feature card template
#
# GPT RULE:
#   - NEVER assume this section is complete.
#   - ALWAYS treat GitHub as the authoritative list of all work items.

# END OF FEATURES
